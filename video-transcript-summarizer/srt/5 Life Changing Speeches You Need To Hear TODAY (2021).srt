1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:08.560
Life is to be lived, lived before you die.

2
0:00:08.560 --> 0:00:12.600
Don't waste a second of this precious gift.

3
0:00:12.600 --> 0:00:15.240
You're here for a reason.

4
0:00:15.240 --> 0:00:19.960
Never stop asking why.

5
0:00:19.960 --> 0:00:25.720
The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched.

6
0:00:25.720 --> 0:00:29.120
They must be felt with a heart.

7
0:00:29.120 --> 0:00:34.360
Here are seven things I need to tell you about life.

8
0:00:34.360 --> 0:00:36.040
Number 1.

9
0:00:36.040 --> 0:00:38.720
Life is not meant to be so serious.

10
0:00:38.720 --> 0:00:43.200
Make time for fun, for joy, for play.

11
0:00:43.200 --> 0:00:47.560
Alan Watts once said, this is the real secret of life.

12
0:00:47.560 --> 0:00:52.400
To be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now.

13
0:00:52.400 --> 0:00:56.600
And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.

14
0:00:56.600 --> 0:01:00.520
Don't trust anyone that tells you life has to be serious.

15
0:01:00.520 --> 0:01:04.280
Don't believe anyone that says there is no time for fun.

16
0:01:04.280 --> 0:01:07.840
Joy, laughter in every or any day.

17
0:01:07.840 --> 0:01:11.600
When you are young, life is nothing but fun.

18
0:01:11.600 --> 0:01:17.920
The important lesson most of us adults still need to learn is that life is not meant to be

19
0:01:17.920 --> 0:01:19.600
so serious.

20
0:01:19.600 --> 0:01:24.600
We can easily forget that our lives do not last forever.

21
0:01:24.600 --> 0:01:28.720
This is why it is important to remind yourself one day.

22
0:01:28.720 --> 0:01:33.760
You, like all other humans, will die.

23
0:01:33.760 --> 0:01:39.240
When we remind ourselves of our certain death, when we remind ourselves of the fact that

24
0:01:39.240 --> 0:01:46.320
we do not know when it will all end, when we really take that in, the impermanence of it

25
0:01:46.320 --> 0:01:47.320
all.

26
0:01:47.320 --> 0:01:54.560
Maybe then, maybe then, we can start taking everything a little less serious.

27
0:01:54.560 --> 0:02:03.200
Mostly, most people are struggling so hard to get the job, to get the extra money.

28
0:02:03.200 --> 0:02:07.200
So they can impress people who they really don't like.

29
0:02:07.200 --> 0:02:12.480
And those people really don't care about them or about any of that anyway.

30
0:02:12.480 --> 0:02:18.200
Because they are doing the same thing, searching for one achievement, that one amount of

31
0:02:18.200 --> 0:02:20.440
money that will make everything better.

32
0:02:20.440 --> 0:02:27.520
But money doesn't make us feel worthy, only we can do that.

33
0:02:27.520 --> 0:02:33.240
Maybe we don't need to stress so much about our weight, our skin, our bank account, or

34
0:02:33.240 --> 0:02:35.720
what other people think of us.

35
0:02:35.720 --> 0:02:43.040
I challenge you to look at life not as a struggle or a strain or a destination that is somewhere

36
0:02:43.040 --> 0:02:46.720
else, needing to be reached.

37
0:02:46.720 --> 0:02:54.320
But a journey, a challenge to see how much joy you can squeeze out of every day.

38
0:02:54.320 --> 0:03:01.680
Then, whether or not you get the big house or the fancy car, it won't matter will it.

39
0:03:01.680 --> 0:03:06.960
Because no matter what happens, you will have what most don't.

40
0:03:06.960 --> 0:03:10.000
Three things money can never buy.

41
0:03:10.000 --> 0:03:14.480
Joy, peace and passion for life.

42
0:03:14.480 --> 0:03:23.880
Create a life that feels good on the inside, not just one that looks good on the outside.

43
0:03:23.880 --> 0:03:29.800
It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.

44
0:03:29.800 --> 0:03:31.440
Number 2.

45
0:03:31.440 --> 0:03:37.360
Circumstances will never define you unless you decide to let them.

46
0:03:37.360 --> 0:03:39.360
Let me tell you a little life, fam.

47
0:03:39.360 --> 0:03:47.080
If you are blessed enough to reach adulthood, there is a 100% chance, yes 100% chance,

48
0:03:47.080 --> 0:03:52.560
that life will disobey you up some things that you did not plan for, nor did you want

49
0:03:52.560 --> 0:03:55.040
in your life experience.

50
0:03:55.040 --> 0:03:58.640
These things are called character building moments.

51
0:03:58.640 --> 0:04:00.320
Life lessons.

52
0:04:00.320 --> 0:04:02.000
Challenges sent.

53
0:04:02.000 --> 0:04:04.560
Maybe to give your life more meaning.

54
0:04:04.560 --> 0:04:10.440
Let me just something you need to deal with in your own time, in your own way.

55
0:04:10.440 --> 0:04:15.800
Wayne Dyer once said, if you change the way you look at things, the things you look at

56
0:04:15.800 --> 0:04:17.760
change.

57
0:04:17.760 --> 0:04:23.080
When you change the way you look at these life challenges, sometimes you will find they

58
0:04:23.080 --> 0:04:30.040
are not problems or misfortunes, but read directions, sometimes blessings.

59
0:04:30.040 --> 0:04:35.760
Maya Angelou said, you may not control all of the events that happened to you, but you

60
0:04:35.760 --> 0:04:40.280
can decide not to be reduced by them.

61
0:04:40.280 --> 0:04:42.400
Don't fight against life.

62
0:04:42.400 --> 0:04:49.200
When challenges come as I guarantee they will, see if you can continue to give your best

63
0:04:49.200 --> 0:04:52.360
to the present moment in front of you.

64
0:04:52.360 --> 0:04:57.840
Be open to the fact that you do not know how anything will turn out, including this

65
0:04:57.840 --> 0:05:05.840
hard moment in front of you, trust that it was for the best for you or for someone else.

66
0:05:05.840 --> 0:05:13.600
See if you can find meaning in any of it, even the hardest moments.

67
0:05:13.600 --> 0:05:19.720
Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.

68
0:05:19.720 --> 0:05:21.040
Number 3.

69
0:05:21.040 --> 0:05:27.000
If you don't learn to control your mind, your mind will control you.

70
0:05:27.000 --> 0:05:30.360
The Buddha said, the mind is everything.

71
0:05:30.360 --> 0:05:35.960
What you think you become, and that is not an extreme statement.

72
0:05:35.960 --> 0:05:40.080
Humans are said to have over 60,000 thoughts a day.

73
0:05:40.080 --> 0:05:41.400
That is not the problem.

74
0:05:41.400 --> 0:05:47.600
The problem is most people are having these thoughts on autopilot, and many of them are

75
0:05:47.600 --> 0:05:49.800
not positive.

76
0:05:49.800 --> 0:05:55.440
Most people are programmed by society, by the news channels, by social media.

77
0:05:55.440 --> 0:06:00.800
They believe everything they read, they are reactive, and when a challenge appears in their

78
0:06:00.800 --> 0:06:07.680
life, they don't know how to handle it, because they don't know how to think for themselves.

79
0:06:07.680 --> 0:06:13.960
Rather than responding calmly and sensibly to fix a small challenge, they react in anger

80
0:06:13.960 --> 0:06:17.960
and escalate the challenge into a monster problem.

81
0:06:17.960 --> 0:06:25.360
Learning to control your mind and to control your emotions is key to living a life

82
0:06:25.440 --> 0:06:27.600
in control.

83
0:06:27.600 --> 0:06:35.160
Not in control of circumstances, but in control of how you feel about them, which is more

84
0:06:35.160 --> 0:06:41.760
important than being in control of circumstances, because that is something you have no control

85
0:06:41.760 --> 0:06:43.160
over.

86
0:06:43.160 --> 0:06:50.160
You control your mind and emotions through daily rituals, consistent self work every day,

87
0:06:50.160 --> 0:06:54.880
repeating powerful processes that are proven to promote calm.

88
0:06:54.880 --> 0:06:56.880
Positive feelings.

89
0:06:56.880 --> 0:07:05.840
Meditation, daily gratitude, prayer, exercise, detoxing from all negativity, specifically news,

90
0:07:05.840 --> 0:07:08.960
negative influences, and social media.

91
0:07:08.960 --> 0:07:14.160
All of these things are crucial to living a beautiful life.

92
0:07:14.160 --> 0:07:18.640
Ultimately, every individual is responsible for how they feel.

93
0:07:18.640 --> 0:07:26.480
This time you react in anger, no, that it is you that needs to do more work, not the circumstance

94
0:07:26.480 --> 0:07:29.080
or the person that made you angry.

95
0:07:29.080 --> 0:07:36.960
No matter what is going on around the world, inside your world, it can be a magical, peaceful

96
0:07:36.960 --> 0:07:40.120
place.

97
0:07:40.120 --> 0:07:45.400
If you're not going with the flow, you're going to slow.

98
0:07:45.400 --> 0:07:47.160
Number 4.

99
0:07:47.160 --> 0:07:51.800
Make a plan, but go with the flow as well.

100
0:07:51.800 --> 0:07:57.800
Jim Ron once said, if you don't design your own life plan, chances are you'll fall into

101
0:07:57.800 --> 0:08:02.520
someone else's plan, and guess what they have planned for you.

102
0:08:02.520 --> 0:08:04.440
Not much.

103
0:08:04.440 --> 0:08:08.440
Planning doesn't mean being attached to the outcome though.

104
0:08:08.440 --> 0:08:13.280
If you plan to take your umbrella on a walk to deal with the rain, but your umbrella

105
0:08:13.280 --> 0:08:16.720
breaks, learn how to dance in the rain.

106
0:08:16.720 --> 0:08:19.160
What does it have to do with your life?

107
0:08:19.160 --> 0:08:23.960
Well, most often in life, you want to avoid getting wet.

108
0:08:23.960 --> 0:08:28.080
As in, you want to avoid getting in financial trouble.

109
0:08:28.080 --> 0:08:33.520
Having health issues, having relationship or emotional problems, having a bad day, a bad

110
0:08:33.520 --> 0:08:38.280
week, bad year, or labeling your life as bad.

111
0:08:38.280 --> 0:08:40.880
How do you avoid the rain of life?

112
0:08:40.920 --> 0:08:43.400
You avoid it by planning.

113
0:08:43.400 --> 0:08:51.480
Not for circumstances to be perfect, but planning to do the work on you every single day.

114
0:08:51.480 --> 0:08:57.680
Planning exercise and healthy eating so your body is strong, healthy and vibrant.

115
0:08:57.680 --> 0:09:03.440
Planning daily rituals like meditation, gratitude, prayer, journaling, or anything else

116
0:09:03.440 --> 0:09:06.240
that puts you in a great space.

117
0:09:06.320 --> 0:09:11.600
All of these things have a profound and compounding effect on your life.

118
0:09:11.600 --> 0:09:16.760
The people you attract, the relationships you attract and strengthen.

119
0:09:16.760 --> 0:09:19.840
How you feel about yourself.

120
0:09:19.840 --> 0:09:26.000
Now of course, not everything always goes to plan, so when a challenge appears, when the

121
0:09:26.000 --> 0:09:31.960
rain of life comes down, learn how to dance in the rain.

122
0:09:31.960 --> 0:09:33.600
How to flow with it.

123
0:09:33.600 --> 0:09:38.720
And most importantly, plan to get back on track.

124
0:09:38.720 --> 0:09:46.960
As Benjamin Franklin once said, if you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.

125
0:09:46.960 --> 0:09:52.400
Sarah, about what other people think and you will always be their prisoner.

126
0:09:52.400 --> 0:09:57.200
Number five, you'll never be able to please everyone.

127
0:09:57.200 --> 0:09:59.280
Yes, that's right.

128
0:09:59.280 --> 0:10:01.480
Even mother Teresa has haters.

129
0:10:01.560 --> 0:10:07.560
No matter how pure your soul is, unfortunately, the reality of human beings is that we are

130
0:10:07.560 --> 0:10:10.120
all so different.

131
0:10:10.120 --> 0:10:16.480
And because of those great differences, we are all vibrating on very different levels.

132
0:10:16.480 --> 0:10:21.120
Some people are just not ready for kindness, peace, compassion.

133
0:10:21.120 --> 0:10:24.680
Some people aren't ready for anything positive.

134
0:10:24.680 --> 0:10:26.320
Don't let that get to you.

135
0:10:26.400 --> 0:10:32.200
It's nothing personal, it's just the very fact that everyone is so different.

136
0:10:32.200 --> 0:10:37.920
And from their difference in upbringing, circumstances, and environment come differences

137
0:10:37.920 --> 0:10:42.080
of opinion and differences in reactions.

138
0:10:42.080 --> 0:10:48.080
Just because they don't agree with you or even if they are against you or your ideas.

139
0:10:48.080 --> 0:10:53.920
Doesn't mean you can't find a way to either get along with them or let them go their own

140
0:10:53.920 --> 0:10:56.280
way in peace.

141
0:10:56.280 --> 0:11:03.000
The very thing you don't want to do is fight back and bring more negative energy to any

142
0:11:03.000 --> 0:11:04.840
situation.

143
0:11:04.840 --> 0:11:09.560
Let those who differ from you differ from you.

144
0:11:09.560 --> 0:11:14.760
Being an example of someone who allows all others to have their opinion without being

145
0:11:14.760 --> 0:11:18.800
affected, move on with your life, without hate.

146
0:11:18.800 --> 0:11:22.880
There is no need for everyone or anyone to agree with you.

147
0:11:22.960 --> 0:11:29.080
Be so busy improving yourself that you don't even notice negativity coming your way.

148
0:11:29.080 --> 0:11:34.720
Be so focused on making a positive difference in the lives of those who want to hear from

149
0:11:34.720 --> 0:11:39.400
you that you fail to hear from those who don't.

150
0:11:39.400 --> 0:11:44.760
Be yourself, everyone else has already taken.

151
0:11:44.760 --> 0:11:46.640
Number 6.

152
0:11:46.640 --> 0:11:51.400
You won't be happy if you're being someone else, trying to fit in with others.

153
0:11:51.400 --> 0:11:54.960
Be yourself and do it with pride.

154
0:11:54.960 --> 0:12:00.680
Genuine happiness will never come to you if you are changing who you are to please other

155
0:12:00.680 --> 0:12:01.920
people.

156
0:12:01.920 --> 0:12:06.920
You cannot be genuinely happy if you are not genuinely you.

157
0:12:06.920 --> 0:12:11.200
Become affordable being you around everyone and anyone.

158
0:12:11.200 --> 0:12:16.480
All the wrong people will leave you and that's okay because the right people will

159
0:12:16.560 --> 0:12:17.480
stay.

160
0:12:17.480 --> 0:12:23.280
The right people as in those who love the real you exactly as you are.

161
0:12:23.280 --> 0:12:30.480
As Dr. Sus said, be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't

162
0:12:30.480 --> 0:12:35.240
matter and those who matter don't mind.

163
0:12:35.240 --> 0:12:38.000
How people treat you is their karma.

164
0:12:38.000 --> 0:12:40.800
How you react is yours.

165
0:12:40.800 --> 0:12:42.200
Number 7.

166
0:12:42.200 --> 0:12:48.280
Those who are stuck in their own misery will try to drag you into their dark home.

167
0:12:48.280 --> 0:12:51.960
Don't let anyone steal your joy.

168
0:12:51.960 --> 0:12:56.960
Wayne Dyer said, loving people live in a loving world.

169
0:12:56.960 --> 0:13:00.360
Hostel people live in a hostile world.

170
0:13:00.360 --> 0:13:01.800
Same world.

171
0:13:01.800 --> 0:13:07.960
The nature of some human beings is that they don't want to see you happy because they

172
0:13:07.960 --> 0:13:11.200
haven't yet achieved it for themselves.

173
0:13:11.200 --> 0:13:17.680
Many people live in a hostile universe and perhaps unknowingly, perhaps unintentionally

174
0:13:17.680 --> 0:13:24.200
will try to drag you into this hostile universe so they are not alone in there.

175
0:13:24.200 --> 0:13:29.080
Never change who you are and drop down into this hostile world.

176
0:13:29.080 --> 0:13:34.960
If you remain true to you, committed to this loving universe you live in, committed to

177
0:13:34.960 --> 0:13:42.360
your own well-being, your own peace, joy and magic you are living in every day.

178
0:13:42.360 --> 0:13:48.320
Sooner or later, all those people will stop trying to drag you down and instead ask you

179
0:13:48.320 --> 0:13:52.360
to help them up to your world.

180
0:13:52.360 --> 0:13:56.480
Be the light for others to find their way.

181
0:13:56.480 --> 0:14:02.040
Be the example that changes not only your life but others through your own positive

182
0:14:02.040 --> 0:14:05.160
life experience.

183
0:14:05.160 --> 0:14:12.120
Eleanor Roosevelt said, no one can make you feel inferior without your consent.

184
0:14:12.120 --> 0:14:15.800
Don't allow the bitterness of others inside your heart.

185
0:14:15.800 --> 0:14:17.800
They don't want to be there either.

186
0:14:17.800 --> 0:14:20.760
They need someone to show them the way.

187
0:14:20.760 --> 0:14:26.400
So many people are hurting and they hide that hurt with bitterness and judgment.

188
0:14:26.400 --> 0:14:34.840
However you can, in any day, in any moment, be that light for someone else, lighten their

189
0:14:34.840 --> 0:14:38.960
day with your genuine kindness.

190
0:14:38.960 --> 0:14:44.960
Even if they don't give it back, be a positive example for this world.

191
0:14:56.400 --> 0:15:06.480
For most of us, our experience of life is always trying to get somewhere else, somewhere

192
0:15:06.480 --> 0:15:10.080
other than where we are.

193
0:15:10.080 --> 0:15:16.480
We're trying to make it to achieve something, something that will make everything better.

194
0:15:16.480 --> 0:15:23.160
We're all trying to get that person, that house, that job, that award, that thing that

195
0:15:23.160 --> 0:15:25.840
will change everything.

196
0:15:25.840 --> 0:15:28.760
Very few of us are present.

197
0:15:28.760 --> 0:15:36.760
Very few of us enjoy the moment we are actually living in because most of us are hoping for

198
0:15:36.760 --> 0:15:40.680
some better future moment.

199
0:15:40.680 --> 0:15:47.080
Somewhere else that is not here, somewhere else that is better than this moment.

200
0:15:47.080 --> 0:15:50.480
But what if there is no where else?

201
0:15:50.480 --> 0:15:53.280
What if that somewhere else never comes?

202
0:15:53.280 --> 0:15:58.000
What if it does come and it doesn't change how we feel?

203
0:15:58.000 --> 0:16:00.400
What if we achieve everything?

204
0:16:00.400 --> 0:16:05.480
We believe we want, yet still feel empty.

205
0:16:05.480 --> 0:16:11.240
What if that place we are all seeking is really only a feeling?

206
0:16:11.240 --> 0:16:17.400
What if we could stop seeking and start feeling how we want to feel?

207
0:16:17.400 --> 0:16:19.400
Without needing anything?

208
0:16:19.400 --> 0:16:26.800
What if that feeling of importance we seek is all an illusion, a construct of the world?

209
0:16:26.800 --> 0:16:31.960
Nothing more than our ego trying to compete with other egos, what if we've been playing

210
0:16:31.960 --> 0:16:37.320
this human game all wrong our entire lives?

211
0:16:37.320 --> 0:16:39.640
What if we would let it all go?

212
0:16:39.640 --> 0:16:45.480
Not the striving to be our best, not the wanting to be our healthiest or happy itself,

213
0:16:45.480 --> 0:16:54.560
but the ego's never ending and ultimately impossible search for significance.

214
0:16:54.560 --> 0:16:57.680
What if we could be kinder to ourselves?

215
0:16:57.680 --> 0:17:03.000
What if we didn't need validation from others, validation from achievements or status

216
0:17:03.000 --> 0:17:04.000
or winning?

217
0:17:04.000 --> 0:17:10.360
What if we didn't need anything outside ourselves to be happy?

218
0:17:10.360 --> 0:17:15.000
What if we didn't need anything outside ourselves to be at peace?

219
0:17:15.040 --> 0:17:17.960
To enjoy life now?

220
0:17:17.960 --> 0:17:20.960
What if we could focus on what matters?

221
0:17:20.960 --> 0:17:23.160
How we feel?

222
0:17:23.160 --> 0:17:26.080
The only thing that matters?

223
0:17:26.080 --> 0:17:33.240
What if that was all just one decision away?

224
0:17:33.240 --> 0:17:38.120
Maybe we should all take a moment to think about it.

225
0:17:45.000 --> 0:17:52.120
You are not your past.

226
0:17:52.120 --> 0:17:55.320
You are not your mistakes.

227
0:17:55.320 --> 0:17:57.440
You are not your failures.

228
0:17:57.440 --> 0:18:00.480
You are not who you were yesterday.

229
0:18:00.480 --> 0:18:03.400
You are not even who you were this morning.

230
0:18:03.400 --> 0:18:07.520
You are who you decide to become, who you commit to become.

231
0:18:07.520 --> 0:18:12.160
You could be one decision away from a completely new life.

232
0:18:12.160 --> 0:18:15.680
You are all capable of reinventing ourselves.

233
0:18:15.680 --> 0:18:21.040
There is absolutely no reason why anyone should live in the dark times of their past

234
0:18:21.040 --> 0:18:25.680
when their future is bright and waiting for them.

235
0:18:25.680 --> 0:18:30.120
Holding on to things that have gone wrong in the past is never going to serve your

236
0:18:30.120 --> 0:18:31.680
future.

237
0:18:31.680 --> 0:18:34.880
It is never going to make you feel good in the present.

238
0:18:34.880 --> 0:18:38.240
It will only increase your suffering.

239
0:18:38.240 --> 0:18:44.040
You have to ask yourself, is that event that moment from my past?

240
0:18:44.040 --> 0:18:52.560
That moment that is over now worthy of sucking all the joy out of my present and my future?

241
0:18:52.560 --> 0:18:57.840
Am I really going to let that moment that person or event win?

242
0:18:57.840 --> 0:19:03.720
Am I really going to let that take away all the joy of my future?

243
0:19:03.720 --> 0:19:05.560
Let it go.

244
0:19:05.560 --> 0:19:07.560
We all make mistakes.

245
0:19:07.600 --> 0:19:09.080
We all do.

246
0:19:09.080 --> 0:19:12.440
Those who move on have the greatest chance of joy.

247
0:19:12.440 --> 0:19:15.560
Both now and in the future.

248
0:19:15.560 --> 0:19:17.400
Forgive yourself.

249
0:19:17.400 --> 0:19:23.200
Forgive everything in everyone and feel the weight dropped from your shoulders as you walk

250
0:19:23.200 --> 0:19:25.560
towards your new life.

251
0:19:25.560 --> 0:19:27.520
Repeat to yourself every day.

252
0:19:27.520 --> 0:19:29.440
I am not my past.

253
0:19:29.440 --> 0:19:31.240
I am not my mistakes.

254
0:19:31.240 --> 0:19:33.240
I am not my failures.

255
0:19:33.240 --> 0:19:35.720
I am who I decide to become.

256
0:19:35.760 --> 0:19:37.960
I am who I commit to become.

257
0:19:37.960 --> 0:19:42.280
I commit to become the best I can be.

258
0:19:42.280 --> 0:19:43.480
I forgive.

259
0:19:43.480 --> 0:19:44.720
I move on.

260
0:19:44.720 --> 0:19:47.600
I look forward to the new me.

261
0:19:47.600 --> 0:19:49.840
My best is yet to come.

262
0:20:06.720 --> 0:20:09.720
Michael Landon once said,

263
0:20:09.720 --> 0:20:17.720
somebody should tell us right at the start of our lives that we are dying.

264
0:20:17.720 --> 0:20:24.720
Then we might live life to the limit every minute of every day.

265
0:20:24.720 --> 0:20:25.720
Do it.

266
0:20:25.720 --> 0:20:29.720
I say whatever you want to do do it now.

267
0:20:29.720 --> 0:20:33.720
There are only so many tomorrow's.

268
0:20:34.720 --> 0:20:36.720
Isn't it amazing?

269
0:20:36.720 --> 0:20:39.720
We all know we are dying.

270
0:20:39.720 --> 0:20:41.720
We all know there's a chance.

271
0:20:41.720 --> 0:20:44.720
There won't be the tomorrow.

272
0:20:44.720 --> 0:20:47.720
Yet none of us really live like we know that.

273
0:20:47.720 --> 0:20:55.720
Two few of us really appreciate each moment like we know that we're here for a short time only.

274
0:20:55.720 --> 0:20:58.720
Two few of us live a life we want to live.

275
0:20:58.720 --> 0:21:02.720
A life we are proud to live.

276
0:21:02.720 --> 0:21:08.720
Two few of us live with purpose and meaning.

277
0:21:08.720 --> 0:21:10.720
Dick not Hans said,

278
0:21:10.720 --> 0:21:14.720
People say walking on water is a miracle.

279
0:21:14.720 --> 0:21:20.720
But to me walking peacefully on earth is the real miracle.

280
0:21:20.720 --> 0:21:23.720
Two many of us are walking around this earth,

281
0:21:23.720 --> 0:21:27.720
Brandtic, stress filled and meaningless.

282
0:21:27.720 --> 0:21:31.720
We should open our eyes and realize

283
0:21:31.720 --> 0:21:36.720
We're not here for long and we are all one.

284
0:21:36.720 --> 0:21:42.720
We should practice the peace we want to see.

285
0:21:42.720 --> 0:21:51.720
Show the love we want to feel and be the person we want to be.

286
0:21:51.720 --> 0:21:53.720
Wayne Dyer said,

287
0:21:54.720 --> 0:21:58.720
Loving people live in a loving world.

288
0:21:58.720 --> 0:22:03.720
Hostile people live in a hostile world.

289
0:22:03.720 --> 0:22:05.720
Same world.

290
0:22:05.720 --> 0:22:06.720
It's a choice.

291
0:22:06.720 --> 0:22:08.720
It's a decision.

292
0:22:08.720 --> 0:22:14.720
We are living in the same world and some of us are living in a loving way.

293
0:22:14.720 --> 0:22:17.720
In some in a hostile way.

294
0:22:17.720 --> 0:22:20.720
We're not here for a long time.

295
0:22:20.720 --> 0:22:23.720
Let's make it a joy-filled time.

296
0:22:23.720 --> 0:22:25.720
You want more time to yourself.

297
0:22:25.720 --> 0:22:26.720
Good.

298
0:22:26.720 --> 0:22:29.720
Spend more time by yourself.

299
0:22:29.720 --> 0:22:33.720
If it's important to you, it's important to your world.

300
0:22:33.720 --> 0:22:35.720
It will make you better.

301
0:22:35.720 --> 0:22:39.720
And that will make those around you better too.

302
0:22:39.720 --> 0:22:43.720
We should remind ourselves that we are all dying.

303
0:22:43.720 --> 0:22:46.720
Never should we carry the burden of hate,

304
0:22:46.720 --> 0:22:49.720
of regret or disappointment.

305
0:22:49.720 --> 0:22:51.720
We only have this moment.

306
0:22:51.720 --> 0:22:59.720
And this is the only moment we can decide to free ourselves from the past and live fully.

307
0:22:59.720 --> 0:23:04.720
Now is the only moment.

308
0:23:04.720 --> 0:23:08.720
Reminding yourself that this is a temporary experience,

309
0:23:08.720 --> 0:23:11.720
freees you from the weight of pressure.

310
0:23:11.720 --> 0:23:17.720
Here's a daily affirmation you can try to bring more positivity to your life.

311
0:23:17.720 --> 0:23:20.720
Today I will search for blessings.

312
0:23:20.720 --> 0:23:25.720
Today I will search for things I can be grateful for.

313
0:23:25.720 --> 0:23:28.720
I know I have a lot to be thankful for.

314
0:23:28.720 --> 0:23:35.720
I know my life is full of blessings, full of meaning, and full of purpose.

315
0:23:35.720 --> 0:23:38.720
I am thankful for my life.

316
0:23:38.720 --> 0:23:42.720
I know I will be on this earth for a short time.

317
0:23:42.720 --> 0:23:46.720
I know I can never know just how short.

318
0:23:46.720 --> 0:23:49.720
That short time will be.

319
0:23:49.720 --> 0:23:54.720
But I do promise to live my best life while I'm here.

320
0:23:54.720 --> 0:24:00.720
I know my physical body is dying, but I am living.

321
0:24:00.720 --> 0:24:04.720
I am loving my life.

322
0:24:04.720 --> 0:24:07.720
I am feeling every blessing.

323
0:24:07.720 --> 0:24:10.720
I am noticing every miracle.

324
0:24:10.720 --> 0:24:14.720
I'm taking time to know what's important to me.

325
0:24:14.720 --> 0:24:21.720
I'm taking time to understand and live my purpose here on earth.

326
0:24:21.720 --> 0:24:24.720
My life is full of meaning.

327
0:24:24.720 --> 0:24:30.720
I live in a loving universe, a peaceful world.

328
0:24:30.720 --> 0:24:38.720
I will walk peacefully on this earth with optimism, with positivity and joy in my heart.

329
0:24:39.720 --> 0:24:42.720
I will be the person I want to be.

330
0:24:42.720 --> 0:24:49.720
No matter how short this life may be, I will not stress over things I cannot control.

331
0:24:49.720 --> 0:24:52.720
I will look for the good.

332
0:24:52.720 --> 0:24:54.720
I know it's always there.

333
0:24:54.720 --> 0:24:56.720
I will look for the smiles.

334
0:24:56.720 --> 0:24:59.720
I will feel the blessings.

335
0:24:59.720 --> 0:25:05.720
I will live today.

336
0:25:08.720 --> 0:25:23.720
Today, I would like to propose to you a way of living.

337
0:25:23.720 --> 0:25:31.720
That if you truly live this way, not only will it improve your life almost instantly,

338
0:25:31.720 --> 0:25:37.720
but it will improve the lives of everyone you come into contact with.

339
0:25:37.720 --> 0:25:46.720
It's not the magic pill, but it will bring a feeling of magic into your life if you live by it.

340
0:25:46.720 --> 0:25:54.720
It's not a winning lottery ticket, but if you live by these principles, you won't need a winning lottery ticket,

341
0:25:54.720 --> 0:26:00.720
or any amount of money, because how you feel will be the reward,

342
0:26:00.720 --> 0:26:06.720
and no amount of money can buy a beautiful existence.

343
0:26:06.720 --> 0:26:11.720
No amount of money can buy a feeling of contentment.

344
0:26:11.720 --> 0:26:16.720
No amount of money can buy peace or joy.

345
0:26:16.720 --> 0:26:19.720
What is this way of living?

346
0:26:19.720 --> 0:26:28.720
It's called nonjar in O in J.A.R.

347
0:26:28.720 --> 0:26:35.720
Living in a state of complete, nonjudgment, nonattachment,

348
0:26:35.720 --> 0:26:40.720
and nonresistence to whatever shows up in your life.

349
0:26:40.720 --> 0:26:44.720
Let's dive deeper into these principles.

350
0:26:44.720 --> 0:26:51.720
If you give me your attention for the next few minutes, I promise it will be a game changer for you.

351
0:26:51.720 --> 0:26:53.720
Nonjudgment.

352
0:26:53.720 --> 0:27:03.720
How often do we, human beings, judge every situation and circumstance that comes into our lives as good or bad?

353
0:27:03.720 --> 0:27:10.720
How often have we all judge situations and circumstances we perceive as bad at the time?

354
0:27:10.720 --> 0:27:16.720
But really, they led to something that ultimately changed our lives for the better.

355
0:27:16.720 --> 0:27:20.720
Maybe it was a breakup that was devastating at the time.

356
0:27:20.720 --> 0:27:24.720
But when looking back, seems like the biggest blessing.

357
0:27:24.720 --> 0:27:32.720
Maybe it was a job loss, or a difficult time financially, that we labeled and judged as bad at the time.

358
0:27:32.720 --> 0:27:41.720
But if it did not happen, we would not be in the great position we are in now, or doing what we now love.

359
0:27:41.720 --> 0:27:47.720
Think of an example in your life where you have judged a situation or circumstance negatively,

360
0:27:47.720 --> 0:27:51.720
but it turned out to be a blessing in some way.

361
0:27:51.720 --> 0:27:58.720
Think of a time when you've judged a person in some way and looking back, you are wrong to do so.

362
0:27:58.720 --> 0:28:01.720
The truth is, we do not know anything.

363
0:28:02.720 --> 0:28:09.720
We can judge and label situations all we like, but we do not know anything.

364
0:28:09.720 --> 0:28:19.720
We can't possibly know the greater lesson or future blessing any situation has for our life in the moment it happens.

365
0:28:19.720 --> 0:28:27.720
When we step back, especially in difficult situations, and observe, rather than judge,

366
0:28:27.720 --> 0:28:39.720
we can respond better with more love for others, with more love for the situation and most importantly, with more love for ourselves.

367
0:28:39.720 --> 0:28:46.720
When we respond in presence, rather than in judgment, we can respond better,

368
0:28:46.720 --> 0:28:55.720
and the flow on effect will mean a better life, a life with more ease and joy.

369
0:28:56.720 --> 0:28:58.720
Non-attachment.

370
0:28:58.720 --> 0:29:03.720
It has been said that attachment is the source of all suffering.

371
0:29:03.720 --> 0:29:12.720
Every human being is guilty of this at some point, but perhaps more so the ambitious ones or the achievers among us.

372
0:29:12.720 --> 0:29:20.720
It's those situations in which we are so attached to the outcome that we identify with it,

373
0:29:20.720 --> 0:29:29.720
and if the outcome doesn't work out as planned, we get upset, depressed, or maybe feel a loss of our sense of self.

374
0:29:29.720 --> 0:29:35.720
You might have experienced this feeling when being attached to a person in a relationship,

375
0:29:35.720 --> 0:29:42.720
or being attached to a certain financial position, being attached to how you are perceived by others,

376
0:29:42.720 --> 0:29:46.720
being attached to a result you've been working towards.

377
0:29:47.720 --> 0:29:52.720
Non-attachment doesn't mean we don't own things.

378
0:29:52.720 --> 0:29:56.720
It means we don't allow things to own us.

379
0:29:56.720 --> 0:30:03.720
We don't allow thoughts and emotions and ideals to own us.

380
0:30:03.720 --> 0:30:11.720
Non-attachment is being able to live and thrive in this world, without being attached to any person,

381
0:30:11.720 --> 0:30:17.720
any thought, feeling, emotion, or any outcome in any way.

382
0:30:17.720 --> 0:30:22.720
Not being attached to anything, being any certain way.

383
0:30:22.720 --> 0:30:28.720
That means being non-attached to any emotion that shows up as well.

384
0:30:28.720 --> 0:30:37.720
So many of us beat ourselves up for getting angry, upset, sad, down, or simply not at our best.

385
0:30:37.720 --> 0:30:43.720
As if the first emotion wasn't bad enough, we punish ourselves for feeling it.

386
0:30:43.720 --> 0:30:49.720
Living in non-attachment, we allow the emotion to take place.

387
0:30:49.720 --> 0:30:52.720
Be witness to it and watch it dissolve.

388
0:30:52.720 --> 0:30:56.720
We witness the emotion, not judge it.

389
0:30:56.720 --> 0:31:06.720
Just like non-judgment, living in non-attachment means living with complete freedom and detachment to what happens.

390
0:31:06.720 --> 0:31:12.720
Whatever circumstances arrive, you accept them as if you had chosen them.

391
0:31:12.720 --> 0:31:16.720
Accepting them does not mean you give up seeking the things you want.

392
0:31:16.720 --> 0:31:27.720
It means whatever happens you accept, while you continue to work toward the things you really want with presence and clarity.

393
0:31:27.720 --> 0:31:34.720
When you live in non-attachment, many of those things you thought you wanted fade away

394
0:31:34.720 --> 0:31:45.720
because you realize they're insignificant and that only leaves what is really important.

395
0:31:45.720 --> 0:31:56.720
Being attached to anything being a certain way, drains you of your power, a Zen proverb that beautifully sums this up says,

396
0:31:56.720 --> 0:32:07.720
Consider the trees which allow the birds to perch and fly away without either inviting them to stay or desiring them never to depart.

397
0:32:07.720 --> 0:32:15.720
If your heart can be like this, you will be near to the way.

398
0:32:15.720 --> 0:32:19.720
Non-resistance.

399
0:32:19.720 --> 0:32:29.720
Eckhart told says non-resistance doesn't mean doing nothing, all it means is that doing becomes non-reactive.

400
0:32:29.720 --> 0:32:35.720
He says, remember the deep wisdom underlying the practice of Eastern martial arts.

401
0:32:35.720 --> 0:32:41.720
Don't resist the opponent's force, yield to overcome.

402
0:32:41.720 --> 0:32:51.720
Much like non-judgment and non-attachment, living in a state of non-resistance means you do not resist what happens.

403
0:32:51.720 --> 0:32:54.720
You no longer fight what is.

404
0:32:54.720 --> 0:33:00.720
What could be more draining of life energy than fighting what is?

405
0:33:00.720 --> 0:33:02.720
There is nothing.

406
0:33:02.720 --> 0:33:07.720
It is why what you resist persists.

407
0:33:07.720 --> 0:33:14.720
Fighting against creates more energy for the thing you are fighting against.

408
0:33:14.720 --> 0:33:24.720
Letting go, accepting and importantly stepping back and being aware of what is actually happening gives you power.

409
0:33:24.720 --> 0:33:35.720
Reacting not an anger or resistance with focus and presence gives you power to change any situation.

410
0:33:35.720 --> 0:33:44.720
When we truly live by these principles, our life and our world around us instantly becomes clearer,

411
0:33:44.720 --> 0:33:53.720
with a greater sense of peace and understanding, everything becomes lighter and our reactions become clearer.

412
0:33:53.720 --> 0:34:01.720
It affects not only our life and our immediate surroundings but the entire planet,

413
0:34:01.720 --> 0:34:09.720
because what could be more powerful than one person living in a beautiful state.

414
0:34:09.720 --> 0:34:17.720
That person's effect on others and the consequent compound effect those people will have on more people.

415
0:34:17.720 --> 0:34:20.720
It is profound.

416
0:34:20.720 --> 0:34:26.720
What a world we can live in if we dedicate our lives in this way.

417
0:34:26.720 --> 0:34:28.720
I pray you all give it a try.

418
0:34:28.720 --> 0:34:35.720
In full presence with pure intentions, many blessings.

419
0:34:56.720 --> 0:35:06.720
Thank you.

420
0:35:26.720 --> 0:35:31.720
Thank you.
