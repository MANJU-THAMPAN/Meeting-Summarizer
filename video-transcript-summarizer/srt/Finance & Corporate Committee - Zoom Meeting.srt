1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.440
meeting open. Welcome everybody. So we'll start with the apologies and I'm

2
0:00:07.440 --> 0:00:11.040
guess we have Hazel. We're only on the same seat here I think. So could I

3
0:00:11.040 --> 0:00:16.320
have a move or please? Andrew just before you did just before you do.

4
0:00:16.320 --> 0:00:21.120
I had to leave the meeting at 130 to attend a future proof meeting. So sorry

5
0:00:21.120 --> 0:00:25.600
about that. So my apologies from then. Good as God. Thanks Jim.

6
0:00:25.600 --> 0:00:31.360
So we should include that and the and the motion as well.

7
0:00:31.360 --> 0:00:37.280
If someone would like to move please. Maybe a move, Mike. Thanks Lou. Thanks Susan.

8
0:00:37.280 --> 0:00:41.760
All in favour. I know. Country know it's carry.

9
0:00:41.760 --> 0:00:46.560
Disclosure of members interests. Do we have any today?

10
0:00:46.560 --> 0:00:51.760
No, well we want to item four late items.

11
0:00:52.720 --> 0:01:02.000
Any late items? No late items. So confirmation of order of meeting. No changes

12
0:01:02.000 --> 0:01:08.640
can. No I don't see any need for for change. We do have a number of

13
0:01:08.640 --> 0:01:13.120
families joining us at the meeting today. But they're well aware of the time. So

14
0:01:13.120 --> 0:01:16.080
I'm yes I'm hoping that will be the required time.

15
0:01:17.040 --> 0:01:20.800
Happy to move Andrew. Graham. Thanks Graham. A second.

16
0:01:20.800 --> 0:01:25.440
A second. Thanks Susan. I think what?

17
0:01:25.440 --> 0:01:28.720
She is all in favour please say aye. I'm not.

18
0:01:28.720 --> 0:01:35.600
I'm not. I'm not really no carried. Okay item six which is confirmation of

19
0:01:35.600 --> 0:01:43.360
the minutes from 18 February. Have we all our take doses being read?

20
0:01:44.320 --> 0:01:50.320
Anything raised from those minutes? Andrew Graham speaking.

21
0:01:51.200 --> 0:01:55.120
My diary showing me that I was at the meeting but my name not recorded there.

22
0:01:56.000 --> 0:01:59.040
Right I was going to bring that up to you. Thank you some.

23
0:02:00.080 --> 0:02:04.960
Mistakes. Thanks Bruce. Okay so I'm sure we can have that remedied Sam.

24
0:02:05.280 --> 0:02:14.240
Yes. Yes we'll make the changes. Thank you. Okay so would that change? Could I have a

25
0:02:14.240 --> 0:02:18.640
mover for the minutes to be received? Is a true and quick rec or please thank you Marcus.

26
0:02:19.520 --> 0:02:24.240
Seconder. I'll second up. Thanks Bruce. All in favour please say aye.

27
0:02:24.240 --> 0:02:32.240
Aye. I. Country no carried. Thank you. Item seven Jason. Has Jason joined us?

28
0:02:32.400 --> 0:02:36.560
The heirs. I see Sam not any high Jason here you're doing.

29
0:02:38.560 --> 0:02:46.800
Good thank you. Great the floor is yours. Okay Sam I don't think we had as we had issues with

30
0:02:46.800 --> 0:02:50.800
trying to get the presentation is that right? Oh no. Sam is sharing brilliant.

31
0:02:51.440 --> 0:03:04.720
Perfect. Thanks Sam. Good morning or good afternoon sorry everyone. Thanks for allowing me

32
0:03:04.720 --> 0:03:10.240
time just to give you a quick update on where we are as a sector for tourism and particularly for

33
0:03:10.240 --> 0:03:16.560
wipe-hard district. So our report has obviously been provided to you and prepared which was our

34
0:03:16.560 --> 0:03:23.280
last six months performance at the end of 31st December 2019 as you would have seen wipe-hard

35
0:03:23.280 --> 0:03:27.280
district council was going through significant growth. Probably one of the fastest growing

36
0:03:27.280 --> 0:03:33.280
regions for us with regards to tourism impact. You were experiencing double digit growth pretty much

37
0:03:33.280 --> 0:03:38.880
through visitor expenditure and also commercial accommodation. But we are here today to

38
0:03:38.880 --> 0:03:44.320
discuss this obviously a bit of a change in the dynamic given COVID and the impact for tourism

39
0:03:44.320 --> 0:03:57.840
particularly as a sector. Go to the next slide Sam. Perfect. So just first a couple of slides

40
0:03:57.840 --> 0:04:04.320
obviously just covering off some data we're now receiving international data on a weekly basis

41
0:04:04.320 --> 0:04:10.480
from the government and also from the airlines. So I've no surprise obviously since COVID locked down

42
0:04:10.480 --> 0:04:14.960
an international trip or restrictions we've put in place. International visitor rivals in

43
0:04:14.960 --> 0:04:19.920
gym New Zealand has been having been dropping it at a very sharp rate. We still do have E-line

44
0:04:19.920 --> 0:04:25.280
connectivity which I will go through because we are still maintaining what we call a baseline

45
0:04:25.280 --> 0:04:31.840
service for connections across the world mainly for repatriation flights but also for cargo and

46
0:04:31.840 --> 0:04:42.480
service across the country as well. Next slide Sam. So weekly hand transitions again no surprise

47
0:04:42.480 --> 0:04:47.760
obviously overall our visitor expenditure is down significantly but when you do look on to the

48
0:04:47.760 --> 0:04:53.760
left top five obviously food like our infamuses we are still seeing some cumulative in some obviously

49
0:04:53.760 --> 0:04:59.760
weekly growth and expenditure compared to all our other visitor type experiences and

50
0:05:00.240 --> 0:05:12.080
changes as well. Thanks Sam. So the impact for us is a sector again look I mean

51
0:05:12.080 --> 0:05:17.440
maybe all of this has been reported but just to cover off in summary we were already impacted

52
0:05:17.440 --> 0:05:21.440
through the loss of China group travel which started in the second to last week of January.

53
0:05:22.240 --> 0:05:28.640
So with that all of our international facing products our hotels, our motels, our E-BNBs

54
0:05:28.960 --> 0:05:33.600
were immediately impacted by that because many of China group travel actually did stay in the

55
0:05:33.600 --> 0:05:38.960
white puddle they were our fourth largest international visitor market behind Australia North America

56
0:05:38.960 --> 0:05:46.000
in New Can Europe. It did shut us down pretty much once international travel restrictions had us

57
0:05:46.560 --> 0:05:50.640
and the visitor economy covers more than just the tourism operators again with mentioned accommodation

58
0:05:50.640 --> 0:05:56.480
it also impacts retail hospitality transport providers our operators of course but also

59
0:05:56.480 --> 0:06:02.320
event organizers in major venues and of course mystery creek of anti-drym in Lake Hada pedal

60
0:06:03.280 --> 0:06:09.040
a key of the in platforms for white puddle district. We have had significant job losses in

61
0:06:09.040 --> 0:06:14.560
business closures across tourism. I have done underneath that last bullet point look the

62
0:06:14.560 --> 0:06:19.120
immediate business impact that we have been coaching our businesses through and helping them get

63
0:06:19.120 --> 0:06:24.160
through. There's some have gone to what we call temporary or seasonal closure so again we have a lot

64
0:06:24.160 --> 0:06:29.200
of seasonality and tourism many who would close for winter have closed but those are potentially

65
0:06:29.200 --> 0:06:34.240
of never closed before we have suggested they go into hibernation and so that's what we're calling

66
0:06:34.240 --> 0:06:38.560
temporary seasonal closures we've had a number of businesses you know Hobarton was obviously

67
0:06:38.560 --> 0:06:45.920
one of the most public ones reported in the media but again all our motels hotels retail hospitality

68
0:06:46.400 --> 0:06:50.720
have pretty much reduced service and staff is only essential services operating as we know

69
0:06:51.440 --> 0:06:57.200
but again with alert level three we do see some opening up potentially in the hospitality sector

70
0:06:57.200 --> 0:07:02.800
for white power anyway and then the last obviously implication for us is we have had a number of

71
0:07:02.800 --> 0:07:07.600
businesses who are permanently closing not only of these are lost definitely to the tourism

72
0:07:07.600 --> 0:07:12.880
industry to try and bring people back when we don't have products but also particularly for

73
0:07:12.880 --> 0:07:18.320
those vulnerable communities where some of these operators have been going for many years thanks

74
0:07:19.200 --> 0:07:26.240
to seeing. Can I ask a question about that? Sure have you got examples of what businesses

75
0:07:26.240 --> 0:07:31.520
they're struggling and like what who isn't closing by who is closing and how it isn't

76
0:07:31.520 --> 0:07:37.440
pecking around the one district? Yeah so particularly for white power it has mainly been

77
0:07:38.000 --> 0:07:44.160
your hospitality potentially some of your retail and also accommodation so we have had many

78
0:07:44.480 --> 0:07:47.840
nearly all of your accommodation has pretty much gone into hibernation or closure

79
0:07:48.720 --> 0:07:51.840
they're calling it temporary closure but there's some of them have been able to access the

80
0:07:51.840 --> 0:07:56.320
white subsidy which is great but again what we're going to see is the impacts along the in the

81
0:07:56.320 --> 0:08:01.440
12 week wage subsidy right now so it's post 12 weeks what we're quite concerned about

82
0:08:02.400 --> 0:08:07.040
we have been lobbying nationally the government and I think that's all sectors not just tourism

83
0:08:07.040 --> 0:08:12.640
around potentially extending the white subsidy for 20 weeks because it will take a lot to restart

84
0:08:13.040 --> 0:08:18.640
the tourism sector again people it's propensity to travel is quite low we will travel locally

85
0:08:18.640 --> 0:08:22.960
and potentially we will travel intra-regionates to stay within the region but

86
0:08:23.680 --> 0:08:27.600
to try and stand up the domestic travel market is going to be a long haul they were looking

87
0:08:27.600 --> 0:08:36.240
at it six to 12 months recovery plan for that. Great so lastly look at I mean

88
0:08:36.240 --> 0:08:39.520
and nothing else that's probably here this was just something we do for industries people

89
0:08:39.520 --> 0:08:44.080
know where we are fit so from the tourism perspective when we respond obviously we're providing

90
0:08:44.080 --> 0:08:50.800
industry support right now at a national level regional level and also a local level but then

91
0:08:50.800 --> 0:08:55.200
we have to walk our chambers of commerce our business associations and all our government

92
0:08:55.920 --> 0:08:59.360
have been great and actually supporting us with what we call the business and community

93
0:08:59.360 --> 0:09:03.840
sort support site for tourism businesses and then lastly we're obviously partnered with

94
0:09:03.840 --> 0:09:08.720
the Civil Defence Network work around providing welfare support not just for tourism operators

95
0:09:08.720 --> 0:09:13.280
again it's also being utilizing tourism operators many of our caterers have now been

96
0:09:13.280 --> 0:09:18.960
repurposed into providing food services pretty much all supporting the food banks and

97
0:09:18.960 --> 0:09:23.520
actually cooking meals we also have a number of our transport operators and tourism being

98
0:09:23.520 --> 0:09:28.880
run basically requisitions now to provide transport options and actually getting people around

99
0:09:28.880 --> 0:09:33.760
such as essential workers in many of the staff potentially we've been redeploying

100
0:09:33.760 --> 0:09:38.160
into the Civil Defence Network through providing security and welfare and

101
0:09:38.160 --> 0:09:43.440
call centre as well so not only are we also working with Civil Defence also putting staff into

102
0:09:43.440 --> 0:09:59.600
the as well. Even though we're obviously dealing with Covid this is just for you to be

103
0:09:59.600 --> 0:10:06.960
aware there are obviously continuing issues that we're going on with Covid and with the tourism industry

104
0:10:06.960 --> 0:10:11.600
first up was domestic airline connectivity so again New Zealand has been pretty open that they

105
0:10:11.600 --> 0:10:16.240
will not be restarting until a little level one so we meet with in New Zealand weekly just to see

106
0:10:16.240 --> 0:10:20.480
how we will try and stand the industry back up again they're going to focus very much on what

107
0:10:20.480 --> 0:10:25.520
we call an incremental restart so it's doing all the work in brief strategy across the country

108
0:10:25.520 --> 0:10:31.120
so potentially maybe only two or three flights into Hamilton per day but again it's the try and get

109
0:10:31.120 --> 0:10:35.680
their reach across the whole network first before they can actually stand up and have a full

110
0:10:35.680 --> 0:10:39.760
schedule like we have seen at a Hamilton Eagle particular over the last three before years.

111
0:10:40.560 --> 0:10:44.800
airline connectivity internationally is still continuing so those are just some summary of some

112
0:10:44.800 --> 0:10:50.560
of the ones that are still flying so again New Zealand are still connecting into North America and Hong Kong

113
0:10:50.560 --> 0:10:55.840
into Australia, Fiji Airlines are still flying into Fiji on a daily service and Qatar has

114
0:10:55.840 --> 0:11:02.720
probably probably used the most to try and repatriate northern hemisphere travellers back to their

115
0:11:02.720 --> 0:11:06.960
homes through Qatar and then also Korean airlines are still operating a daily service as well.

116
0:11:07.920 --> 0:11:12.160
For future again in New Zealand are saying they will be focusing very much on the domestic market

117
0:11:12.160 --> 0:11:17.600
first they will traditionally be a domestic airline for the first six to 12 months and domestic

118
0:11:17.600 --> 0:11:22.800
also includes Australia in the Pacific. American Airlines so far have been the only one we've met

119
0:11:22.800 --> 0:11:28.320
with who planned to return to New Zealand from October 2020 so they have put a stake in the ground

120
0:11:28.400 --> 0:11:33.360
to say when they will start flying into New Zealand again. Now the reason why I just raised

121
0:11:33.360 --> 0:11:39.600
international airline connectivity is because it will take this country at least two to five years

122
0:11:39.600 --> 0:11:45.840
before we ever go back to the type of connectivity we've had as a country previously before lockdown.

123
0:11:45.840 --> 0:11:51.680
So again it's going to be a very long boom for us as a country to regain international

124
0:11:51.680 --> 0:11:56.560
visitor rivals with senior the past. Air Trevor control services up for review the reason why I

125
0:11:56.560 --> 0:12:01.520
just put that in there is just to let everyone know there was no whi-cutter wear ports or earfields

126
0:12:01.520 --> 0:12:06.400
but particularly Hamilton Epoot as an impacted but for us in the central North Island, Routalua is

127
0:12:06.400 --> 0:12:10.320
one that is going to be impacted around potentially the closure of air traffic control to our

128
0:12:10.320 --> 0:12:15.360
services that will mean potentially that we will be re-deverting the domestic network through

129
0:12:15.360 --> 0:12:22.320
Toronto and Hamilton so unfortunately for Routalua's last it could be our game and then lastly we've

130
0:12:22.320 --> 0:12:26.720
still got the investigation underway around Fakari White Island so the work safe investigation

131
0:12:26.720 --> 0:12:32.800
should be going to a close shortly there will be impacts on the tourism and suppliers around

132
0:12:32.800 --> 0:12:37.600
adventure tourism for this country and also we will be at waiting qualmark which is our

133
0:12:37.600 --> 0:12:42.000
accreditation program particularly around health and safety for the country.

134
0:12:42.000 --> 0:12:46.000
Thanks Sam.

135
0:12:47.840 --> 0:12:54.560
Just some of the things that dates are some new we are now. Field days is going online so from the

136
0:12:54.560 --> 0:12:59.440
30th of June for two weeks. Field days will be providing a virtual exhibition space

137
0:12:59.440 --> 0:13:03.760
very similar to other international events you offer this type of experience. Again it does

138
0:13:03.760 --> 0:13:09.360
a trial but we do hope to bring Field days back in 2021 obviously not only is the largest major

139
0:13:09.360 --> 0:13:15.280
event for WIPAR but it's definitely for the WIPAR to be a good economic impact. We worked

140
0:13:15.280 --> 0:13:19.440
due to hosting the Zealand tourism awards in November that has been postponed until next year

141
0:13:19.440 --> 0:13:24.720
so we will reset the date for that. Explore and trends these are what we call our two main

142
0:13:24.720 --> 0:13:31.200
international trade shows. The obviously being delayed trends 2021 which is the main time when we

143
0:13:31.200 --> 0:13:36.880
actually sell the WIPAR to the world we will not be having until maybe June next year so it's

144
0:13:36.880 --> 0:13:41.920
just the waiting on a date for that. Two major convention centres were due to open the

145
0:13:41.920 --> 0:13:47.280
year to pay and Christo which potentially is the one that will be taking a lot of business away

146
0:13:47.280 --> 0:13:52.400
for us for business events that is now being delayed for another year and of course that in

147
0:13:52.400 --> 0:13:57.040
New Zealand International Convention Centre we will not know the reopening date of that until

148
0:13:57.040 --> 0:14:02.240
they work through the final insurance claims. So again by having these two convention centres

149
0:14:02.320 --> 0:14:08.080
not operating means that places like Trudlands and the Mystery Creek of Bint Centre are going to be

150
0:14:08.080 --> 0:14:13.280
filling the gap for national and international conferences for the short term which is actually

151
0:14:13.280 --> 0:14:19.200
a good opportunity for us again as a region post-COVID. But we also do still have a Vint plane

152
0:14:19.200 --> 0:14:26.320
so the major events obviously the National Waka Amos at this stage still plans to take a

153
0:14:26.320 --> 0:14:31.120
take a take a fit and let cut up here though and we also have our first major event for the region

154
0:14:31.600 --> 0:14:36.560
that ICC woman's cricket wheelcarts scheduled for the 8th of February again. This one will

155
0:14:36.560 --> 0:14:42.960
particularly be decided by around October no Vimba whether we are international travel restrictions

156
0:14:42.960 --> 0:14:48.800
have lifted to enable some of the players to come otherwise they will have to go into if it

157
0:14:48.800 --> 0:14:55.360
does continue until isolation until the cricket wheel cup can be held. So what we have seen

158
0:14:55.360 --> 0:15:00.800
particularly for other parts of the sector is that Vint has been more postpone for

159
0:15:00.800 --> 0:15:06.640
Wipa and for the wider Waka to region rather than completely cancelled or not returning. So

160
0:15:06.640 --> 0:15:11.040
there is some positivity for us as we do see this is the lead sector to enter a covering

161
0:15:11.840 --> 0:15:16.800
economically and socially for the district. Excite Sam.

162
0:15:23.760 --> 0:15:29.840
Response we have a what we have three tier response plan obviously this is no similar to everyone

163
0:15:29.920 --> 0:15:35.920
else right now we have a mitigate process with security and now we then have a restart phase and

164
0:15:35.920 --> 0:15:40.960
then we have a reimagined phase. So initially in the response phase no different to everyone.

165
0:15:40.960 --> 0:15:45.680
Now lots of briefings a lot of support we obviously have been faced to face briefings across all the

166
0:15:45.680 --> 0:15:50.560
sector long before the shutdown and now we move to the virtual space we are still doing

167
0:15:50.560 --> 0:15:55.280
ever-concerning national level to try and make sure we can access more business support for the region.

168
0:15:55.760 --> 0:16:00.320
Some of the gap right now at a government support and out of the support that Waka can provide

169
0:16:00.320 --> 0:16:06.800
does it doesn't cover any employees for 100 employees plus. So that's quite this quite the point

170
0:16:06.800 --> 0:16:12.000
end of town we call it for most of our region for our big employers. Again weight subsidy okay

171
0:16:12.000 --> 0:16:15.840
but on the outside of that there's actually no large industry support so we've been pushing

172
0:16:15.840 --> 0:16:20.720
that through government to try and unlock some of that if this lockdown continues we've been doing

173
0:16:20.720 --> 0:16:26.000
one or one operated chickens we have 240 listed operators for us so again these are daily

174
0:16:26.000 --> 0:16:29.920
to weekly chickens by all our teams to make sure we've been able to access business advice

175
0:16:30.640 --> 0:16:35.520
and some of the wage support we've been doing webinars and we've now moved in the last two weeks

176
0:16:35.520 --> 0:16:41.840
into workforce read deployment so again we've been taking some organisations on employers that

177
0:16:41.840 --> 0:16:47.120
have maybe at least five to ten staff members displaced through to Hobbiton who had one of the

178
0:16:47.120 --> 0:16:52.640
largest that around 270 and actually redeploying them and offering them redeployment options

179
0:16:52.640 --> 0:16:58.720
into the Kiwi Freedom Distry we've placed a 110 staff into Kiwi fruit with transport from Hobbiton

180
0:16:58.720 --> 0:17:03.440
as well as the avocado industry which will be the next seasonal workforce will be

181
0:17:03.440 --> 0:17:07.920
will be standing up until the end of the year but put staff into supermarket civil defense

182
0:17:07.920 --> 0:17:13.840
security and also there've been providing some services from home but again what we are going to

183
0:17:13.840 --> 0:17:17.680
see over the next two weeks and we're starting to measure that is the full unpaid so people

184
0:17:17.680 --> 0:17:23.280
that we cannot read the point that potentially will be able to work so our theory is currently

185
0:17:23.280 --> 0:17:28.000
a survey underway and we'll be updating all councils in the government around the overall

186
0:17:28.000 --> 0:17:33.360
impact for tourism and why cuts in.

187
0:17:33.360 --> 0:17:38.720
Under the restart phase so again we want to congratulate local government because obviously

188
0:17:38.880 --> 0:17:43.440
getting some of those shovel-rooted projects through with the Crown Infrastructure Partners

189
0:17:43.440 --> 0:17:48.320
for their consideration is a great win for the region but potentially for the sector pretty much

190
0:17:48.320 --> 0:17:54.400
every district has put up around one to tourism and projects as part of shovel-rooted so again

191
0:17:55.280 --> 0:18:01.600
we do need to focus on the future and how we'll restart the region research and we were

192
0:18:01.600 --> 0:18:05.680
already in market and about to finish up our domestic perceptions and majorly research

193
0:18:06.240 --> 0:18:10.320
this is now becoming quite timely for us and will help us inform around how we will try and

194
0:18:10.320 --> 0:18:16.400
bring back the domestic travelers into the region based on some of the research we've undertaken.

195
0:18:17.120 --> 0:18:20.960
We're also working on a major in business events restart campaign so that planning has been

196
0:18:20.960 --> 0:18:25.760
underway for a couple of weeks so that when we're ready to go we can push go on that we do see

197
0:18:25.760 --> 0:18:31.040
events and business events and corporate travel is being the kickstarter we need for economic

198
0:18:31.040 --> 0:18:36.960
and social recovery across the region new developments again you've all got new developments going on

199
0:18:36.960 --> 0:18:41.840
potentially in your regions head and leg obviously one of your newest hotels in Cambridge

200
0:18:41.840 --> 0:18:46.320
and open dog Christmas Eve so Glinder and the team will be keeping in touch with quite a lot

201
0:18:46.320 --> 0:18:51.680
because they haven't been in operation very long they're impacts are quite severe so again

202
0:18:51.680 --> 0:18:56.080
making sure that we still have some future developments that will continue across the region

203
0:18:56.800 --> 0:19:01.680
to take us through the next stage data and insights I've touched on them now gone to

204
0:19:01.680 --> 0:19:06.320
weekly so again we're sharing that information in to Walker and now we've been shooting

205
0:19:06.320 --> 0:19:11.280
into the to Walker economic outlook as well which is great and then lastly the mighty local

206
0:19:11.280 --> 0:19:16.560
campaign was launched two weeks ago and it's definitely around the restart phase thanks.

207
0:19:21.120 --> 0:19:25.840
So mighty local again was a partnership with ourselves to Walker all the chambers of

208
0:19:25.840 --> 0:19:30.880
commerce so to our mood to obviously Cambridge Chamber of Commerce plus the Wacatto Chamber of

209
0:19:30.880 --> 0:19:35.680
Commerce all our councils the business associations it all exists in some communities and

210
0:19:35.680 --> 0:19:40.480
all our regional eye sites we're in phase one so for the last two weeks we've been promoting

211
0:19:40.480 --> 0:19:45.600
businesses with contactless delivery promoting you know on people that are still doing

212
0:19:45.600 --> 0:19:50.800
entertainment online or virtually from within Wacatto recipes from our beloved chefs well-being

213
0:19:50.800 --> 0:19:55.600
and fitness and this week we launched business stories so again we're starting to use this

214
0:19:55.600 --> 0:20:00.960
platform to promote some of the businesses and how they're pivoting into obviously response

215
0:20:00.960 --> 0:20:05.280
or looking at different opportunities for the business so the idea is to try and give people hope

216
0:20:05.280 --> 0:20:10.080
during phase one during phase two which is obviously from a loot level three we will increase

217
0:20:10.080 --> 0:20:14.960
the article and eat from bee listings and also essential services are starting to grow as well

218
0:20:15.680 --> 0:20:20.080
and phase two we will move more to a local phase at the moment it's a regional platform

219
0:20:20.080 --> 0:20:24.080
but the idea is potentially people we're able to to to have to group the types of

220
0:20:24.400 --> 0:20:29.680
information in services available at a local delivery level and at a district level as well

221
0:20:30.800 --> 0:20:34.560
and then phase three which has been hopefully all travel restrictions are lifted

222
0:20:35.120 --> 0:20:41.360
we will then activate the basically the the bi-local eat local event local shop visit and explore

223
0:20:41.360 --> 0:20:45.360
within the region and obviously that's in partnership with many communities and business

224
0:20:45.360 --> 0:20:51.600
associations that already have local programs such as Cambridge with the totally locally Cambridge

225
0:20:51.600 --> 0:20:54.880
campaign so we're working with Kelly and the team around how we're trying

226
0:20:54.880 --> 0:20:58.800
push the program rather than this one once we give to phase three

227
0:21:01.120 --> 0:21:01.600
thanks him

228
0:21:06.320 --> 0:21:12.720
and when it comes to how we will actually respond long term so at the moment we're in phase one

229
0:21:12.720 --> 0:21:18.160
so we're calling it the hyper local phase so one to three months we'll be pushing basically localism

230
0:21:19.040 --> 0:21:23.040
everything to do with obviously how you purchase an inter-equal via local community

231
0:21:23.760 --> 0:21:27.840
it phase two which will move into a three to six month break at we're estimating we can then

232
0:21:27.840 --> 0:21:33.280
start to do inter-regional travel so we're targeting the drive market within the wide-cut or region

233
0:21:34.080 --> 0:21:38.560
we hopefully starting to stand up community events again they can have a local level

234
0:21:38.560 --> 0:21:42.480
and regional business meetings might be able to begin again with social distancing

235
0:21:43.600 --> 0:21:47.520
at level three which is what we're planning our scenarios for six to 12 months we can then

236
0:21:47.520 --> 0:21:53.200
stand up the domestic market that is when potentially we will mainly focus on drive so

237
0:21:53.200 --> 0:21:59.520
as you've heard me say before 2.5 potentially 3 million people live within three hours radius

238
0:21:59.520 --> 0:22:04.320
of the wide-cut region including the region itself so we'll definitely be focusing on the drive

239
0:22:04.320 --> 0:22:10.160
market national events will be returning as well as national meetings and then eventually corporate

240
0:22:10.160 --> 0:22:15.040
travel which again business are quite a good lead for us with regards to our stand-up

241
0:22:15.520 --> 0:22:19.840
for the sector again and then lastly we're planning on one to two years before we

242
0:22:19.840 --> 0:22:26.000
actually start to see any sort of international impact again. Short haul markets into Australia

243
0:22:26.000 --> 0:22:30.880
and the Pacific will open first and then we will eventually move back into major events

244
0:22:30.880 --> 0:22:35.280
international conferences and starting to bring back the corporate and leisure travel market into

245
0:22:35.280 --> 0:22:40.640
wide-cut also that's the time frame we are currently doing our scenario planning for but as we

246
0:22:41.360 --> 0:22:48.160
may change every week based on your levels we have.

247
0:22:52.000 --> 0:22:57.680
And then lastly Rea Meijan so you would have seen that last week or actually two weeks ago as

248
0:22:57.680 --> 0:23:03.280
well the government announced that there was a call to reshape and re-imagined the tourism industry

249
0:23:03.280 --> 0:23:07.520
so we have been pushing for the last two to three months with tourism, New Zealand and the

250
0:23:07.520 --> 0:23:13.120
Minister for Tourism around what we're calling a re-imagining of tourism where we there was our

251
0:23:13.120 --> 0:23:17.120
chance that this is more than a shock it's actually a bit of a circuit breaker for the sector and for

252
0:23:17.120 --> 0:23:21.360
all business sectors for us all to look and see how could we do our businesses differently.

253
0:23:21.920 --> 0:23:26.720
We all knew that tourism was growing in quite an exponential rate and there were some areas

254
0:23:26.720 --> 0:23:32.880
that were really filling the pressure such as Queen's Town in central Otago and Cathedral Cove

255
0:23:32.880 --> 0:23:38.240
some of our sites Mount Tomaruto so for us now it's great to see the government are taking

256
0:23:38.240 --> 0:23:41.520
the seriously so we're now working with tourism, New Zealand to lead our new plan,

257
0:23:42.320 --> 0:23:46.400
to be particularly internationally but also look at all these types of questions you know we're

258
0:23:46.400 --> 0:23:51.280
our previous visitor rivals and expenditure growth right for the region what will success

259
0:23:51.280 --> 0:23:55.920
it look like for us for the future for a visit a market how we move our sector from boom and

260
0:23:55.920 --> 0:24:00.800
bus to gain no different to the food and fiber sector or any other person's cycle and lastly

261
0:24:00.800 --> 0:24:06.000
how do we move to more sustainable community tourism and for us and the Whicat's of what we call

262
0:24:06.000 --> 0:24:11.280
creating net benefit rather than just benefiting those their potentially we're making money out of tourism

263
0:24:11.280 --> 0:24:16.240
we want to see community thrive and that they have the decision around what sort of tourism they want

264
0:24:16.240 --> 0:24:22.000
so again we will be moving our 2016 tourism opportunities plan which many of you were involved in

265
0:24:22.720 --> 0:24:26.640
we will now be developing a destination management plan and that will be happening nationally as

266
0:24:27.520 --> 0:24:33.680
to try and what we call transform tourism for the beta so there is no such word as recovery now

267
0:24:33.680 --> 0:24:39.440
we will not be receiving the same sorts of level of tourism as we did previously but neither we might

268
0:24:39.440 --> 0:24:44.400
not have the same sort of services and opportunities available in tourism as well post COVID so

269
0:24:44.400 --> 0:24:47.920
again it is a good opportunity for us to have a transform in the sector.

270
0:24:48.800 --> 0:24:58.080
I think we've got one more. Looking lastly to obviously I call it to all my life government partners

271
0:24:58.640 --> 0:25:04.160
I really appreciate everyone helping to promote your rates for the emissions and installment policies

272
0:25:04.160 --> 0:25:09.360
not just for the tourism sector but for all business. It's great to see you all continuing with

273
0:25:09.360 --> 0:25:14.640
your resource consent process maybe in a more delayed way but again the liquor and food

274
0:25:14.720 --> 0:25:19.440
license is going to be more important for us particularly we try and stand up after a little three

275
0:25:20.320 --> 0:25:25.600
we still have the regional major event strategy activations so again we are still awaiting some

276
0:25:26.880 --> 0:25:31.040
a decision from well energy trust about potentially helping to establish a regional major

277
0:25:31.040 --> 0:25:36.080
of in-spun which will actually assist all the districts to be able to bid for major events again

278
0:25:36.960 --> 0:25:42.400
and also to attract and bid new major events into our shallvases and across the region and then

279
0:25:42.480 --> 0:25:47.920
lastly again just to thank you all for your continual funding to support the tourism industry and

280
0:25:47.920 --> 0:25:53.280
that would obviously be more important through restart in the re-imagined phase and again the

281
0:25:53.280 --> 0:25:58.240
point I made earlier we will not be recovering to pre COVID levels for at least two five years

282
0:25:59.040 --> 0:26:06.960
as a sector and as a region. That's pretty much it from me. Thank you. So happy to take any questions.

283
0:26:07.680 --> 0:26:15.360
Thanks Jason. I got to say that's a fantastic response to what must have been a

284
0:26:15.360 --> 0:26:24.160
massive shock to the industry. And of course in white power and probably a lot of white

285
0:26:24.160 --> 0:26:32.240
care to as well. The mystic tourism is actually a lot bigger than international so we really want

286
0:26:32.240 --> 0:26:41.120
to see and as you have in your plan that being worked on as soon as it's become a possibility.

287
0:26:41.120 --> 0:26:45.120
But yeah does anyone have questions just put your hands up or can see you all clear?

288
0:26:46.160 --> 0:26:53.600
Okay yes that thanks a lot Jason and you are fantastic. If I think being put in by all your team

289
0:26:53.600 --> 0:26:59.680
in the situation a couple of questions well the first one was that I noticed that in the

290
0:26:59.680 --> 0:27:07.200
original major of being strategy these are new funding partner mentioned is that the well-energy

291
0:27:07.200 --> 0:27:13.360
relationship was it? Great you said it's well-energy. Yeah and that's great. And the other thing

292
0:27:13.360 --> 0:27:20.480
is for your reimagining the future of tourism I saw that you had your stakeholders listed.

293
0:27:20.480 --> 0:27:26.480
I didn't see the Department of Conservation there not that they are a tourism operator but most

294
0:27:26.560 --> 0:27:35.360
of our popular destinations I think of Cathedral Coves they are actually managed by the Department

295
0:27:35.360 --> 0:27:42.880
and I just wonder if it would be worthwhile trying to get them around the table because I hear

296
0:27:43.840 --> 0:27:49.760
they worry about the pressure points that we were experiencing and that just having their input

297
0:27:51.280 --> 0:27:56.080
might be beneficial. Yeah it's not so absolutely so you're sorry about that clear.

298
0:27:57.040 --> 0:28:00.960
Department of Conservation are part of that so it's actually a joint tourism, New Zealand and Dock

299
0:28:01.440 --> 0:28:06.720
review of tourism and it's only because they both actually contributed to the national tourism

300
0:28:06.720 --> 0:28:11.040
of tier-all strategies so they're definitely part of it we don't obviously have a lot of

301
0:28:11.040 --> 0:28:16.080
any national parts but we do still have a lot of crown estate in some of the crown estate in our region

302
0:28:16.080 --> 0:28:21.360
or obviously so about our waterfalls and lake areas so again and along our rivers we just

303
0:28:21.360 --> 0:28:26.560
and they will be engaging in that as well because we did obviously have some opportunities with Dock

304
0:28:26.560 --> 0:28:31.520
originally before COVID so the developing short walks for the region and the right walks

305
0:28:31.520 --> 0:28:36.080
mental so there's some projects that we now have bought forward again to say can we'll

306
0:28:36.080 --> 0:28:40.880
dock reconsider moving some of those solidly still. Yeah that sounds fantastic you know welcome.

307
0:28:44.240 --> 0:28:50.640
We have any other questions. Liz yeah I guess just a huge thank you Jason to the support you

308
0:28:50.720 --> 0:28:57.440
have operators you know I've been affected a little myself and the calls that I get from your

309
0:28:57.440 --> 0:29:03.440
Tina appearing encouraging it's very certain. Just one of the things I just wanted to

310
0:29:03.440 --> 0:29:07.680
check in with you on and that's we do have a presentation a little bit later for the moment

311
0:29:07.680 --> 0:29:11.680
the territory and I see you've also given me some support and that's really great who are

312
0:29:11.680 --> 0:29:18.240
aligned on a lot of the international visitors and I guess it's lucky for us in some ways that

313
0:29:18.240 --> 0:29:21.360
there's not that many white power operators that are aligned on international's.

314
0:29:22.000 --> 0:29:26.480
I'm going to tell you as probably one of them perhaps our eyesight to a certain degree in

315
0:29:26.480 --> 0:29:31.120
civil-scient national kiss but other than that do you think that there are any other

316
0:29:31.120 --> 0:29:34.800
aspects of white power that are going to be greatly affected with international's because it's

317
0:29:34.800 --> 0:29:40.080
really with the biggest you know issues going to be. It's mainly going to be the sports

318
0:29:40.720 --> 0:29:45.920
sports code so I think if we can try and get some of the international sporting events back up

319
0:29:45.920 --> 0:29:50.400
running as soon as possible depending on travel restrictions they would be the main and

320
0:29:50.400 --> 0:29:54.240
peak for white power but you are correct look pretty much most of our events which are great

321
0:29:54.880 --> 0:29:59.440
and our operators pretty much talked to the domestic market and I still feel that again look

322
0:29:59.440 --> 0:30:03.200
the white country of expressway and probably other work that potentially has been put forward

323
0:30:03.200 --> 0:30:08.160
for Shabba Riddie even extending expressway down to Pied Edy that that's just all going to help

324
0:30:08.160 --> 0:30:14.000
that ease of domestic travel and we do see the push from self drive obviously the motor home

325
0:30:14.000 --> 0:30:18.080
in Caravian association they are going to be another first lead up and move it back into the region

326
0:30:18.080 --> 0:30:23.520
as well which is fantastic so we're going to be a demon AA traveler around trying to get more

327
0:30:23.520 --> 0:30:31.120
people back into white power so I think again your geographic location, your natural environment

328
0:30:31.120 --> 0:30:36.000
and also your have been played for some hold you on a stronger position around obviously

329
0:30:36.000 --> 0:30:43.680
recovery of your other parts of our region. Great okay thanks very much for that you

330
0:30:44.240 --> 0:30:48.000
you've done an awful lot of work and you've got a lot more in front of you I can see

331
0:30:49.040 --> 0:30:54.320
but that's great and if we've got no more queries I'll we have a recommendation do we have a move

332
0:30:54.320 --> 0:31:01.920
a please thanks Marcus thanks Claire on favour please say aye I

333
0:31:02.560 --> 0:31:08.720
country no carried thanks very much Jason all the best thank you I rely on you thank you

334
0:31:08.800 --> 0:31:19.840
and thank Sam good work yes I see we have Matt sorry Matt Morgan with us yet and also

335
0:31:21.520 --> 0:31:29.120
Kelvin and Andrew are at the air we'll get to you guys before long but Matt from CEE

336
0:31:29.840 --> 0:31:36.480
Hamilton Airport yeah the floor of what yours and no I just like Jason I'm you have had a mess of

337
0:31:36.560 --> 0:31:45.520
change of your business so yeah the tea here you're going on. Thank you thank Andrew and thanks

338
0:31:45.520 --> 0:31:53.200
for the opportunity uh welcome to all of the uh elective members um hopefully we've got a presentation

339
0:31:53.200 --> 0:32:00.880
coming up and that should be before you now uh look today I've also got Scott Kendall my finance manager

340
0:32:01.840 --> 0:32:07.600
thank you so Scott will deal with a couple of the finance slides and uh as most of what we

341
0:32:07.600 --> 0:32:12.000
have to talk you about is and and the rooms are finance so I'm just for the heaven here

342
0:32:12.640 --> 0:32:19.680
perhaps not quite the presentation I had intended to present a month ago but as we know a lot has

343
0:32:19.680 --> 0:32:28.000
changed and a mess of a mount has changed for rail in the in the last three or four weeks so the

344
0:32:28.000 --> 0:32:35.680
presentation is is primarily in a frequency and move to the next slide as primarily around the

345
0:32:36.640 --> 0:32:44.400
COVID-19 response for rail but I thought and there's about eight or nine slides to the key

346
0:32:44.400 --> 0:32:51.920
slides to take you through and I think what you'll see is how we've dealt with the crisis

347
0:32:52.640 --> 0:33:00.720
what the implications have been for the group now and for the next 15 months and uh and a summary

348
0:33:00.720 --> 0:33:08.400
that um shed some some positive light at the end of the tunnel um thanks Sam if we move on um

349
0:33:09.280 --> 0:33:16.640
so I guess the first point I think is useful too um you've obviously received our six-month

350
0:33:16.640 --> 0:33:22.240
interim results some say you're only as good as your last results but sadly that's not the uh

351
0:33:22.240 --> 0:33:28.240
not quite the case today but look we were traveling extremely well very very good first uh six

352
0:33:28.240 --> 0:33:35.200
months and in fact on target for a record of financial performance uh under any measure um of our

353
0:33:35.200 --> 0:33:41.760
SII for this this financial year but of course and that lead to our draft yes or why that you've also

354
0:33:41.760 --> 0:33:48.240
received and uh that of course is now pretty much irrelevant and I see that you are ironically

355
0:33:48.240 --> 0:33:55.840
having a pinned at sleta to my chair Barry Harris about um about OSI and as you can imagine we are

356
0:33:55.840 --> 0:34:02.960
working very uh quickly towards a revised S.W.I for the next three years um

357
0:34:04.000 --> 0:34:09.440
particularly the financials but also there'll be some narrative change and some priority changing as well

358
0:34:10.400 --> 0:34:16.800
we have us to say um completed a very detailed 15 month forecast through the 30 June next year

359
0:34:17.360 --> 0:34:25.040
that will form of course now part of the year one of the um of the S.W.I so look we have a um we have a

360
0:34:25.040 --> 0:34:31.760
presentation the row board and myself has a presentation to all share holding councils in May

361
0:34:32.400 --> 0:34:42.000
and we by that stage we'll have finalized the new drafts um so um moving

362
0:34:42.880 --> 0:34:53.280
all right moving on to the next slide um so I think now just looking at the um the impact and look

363
0:34:53.280 --> 0:34:59.600
very difficult to um well it's very easy to explain in simple terms it's had a massive impact

364
0:34:59.680 --> 0:35:05.120
on the business but if I divided into these four areas that are before you of course the first

365
0:35:05.120 --> 0:35:11.680
result is the aeronautical business um in New Zealand complete as you know suspension of flights

366
0:35:12.720 --> 0:35:20.240
so uh for us that was an immediate um loss of income really from April but from the last week of March

367
0:35:21.520 --> 0:35:28.960
and along with our general aviation L3 Harris Supply at school basically you know 97 98

368
0:35:28.960 --> 0:35:35.680
descent loss of our aeronautical income overnight um terminal flows and we really operating

369
0:35:35.680 --> 0:35:42.720
as an emergency medical um service only at the airport um had the same impact on our

370
0:35:42.720 --> 0:35:49.200
on our property but in fact our property is our lifeline that I will come to but again really overnight

371
0:35:49.920 --> 0:35:56.560
impact on our tendencies we're quite a large landlord as you know and um but to date and

372
0:35:56.640 --> 0:36:02.240
Scott will talk a wee bit about this but today we've had good support from our tenants um but we're

373
0:36:02.240 --> 0:36:08.320
early days as we know into the next sort of three to six months as businesses work through how they're

374
0:36:08.320 --> 0:36:16.400
going to operate uh and survive during this process um we've obviously suspended the terminal um

375
0:36:16.400 --> 0:36:21.760
upgrade work and I'll talk to that a bit further on which of course was a major piece of work

376
0:36:21.840 --> 0:36:29.760
approximately 15 million dollars of of proposed work. A hotel has been sorry if we can just go back

377
0:36:29.760 --> 0:36:38.720
to the previous slide Sam the hotel um impacted significantly as well uh fortunately during April we

378
0:36:39.360 --> 0:36:47.280
was um uh taken over by Ministry of Health as a isolation facility it wasn't required it was a

379
0:36:47.280 --> 0:36:54.000
backup to the Auckland hotels um nonetheless we have received um and we are receiving payment for

380
0:36:54.000 --> 0:37:01.280
the use of the hotel by the government but that ends really this week and from then on um a

381
0:37:01.280 --> 0:37:08.160
difficult times ahead and we'll talk about that and um obviously our people um all my team are working

382
0:37:08.160 --> 0:37:14.960
remotely that's working very very well um might sort of a live in a 12-hour immediate COVID team response

383
0:37:15.840 --> 0:37:23.760
but of course the cafe and store staff um our at home unable to work and part of the government

384
0:37:23.760 --> 0:37:32.000
subsidy our rescue far teen does remain on site at this point so that's really been the impact

385
0:37:32.000 --> 0:37:40.080
what have we really tried to do about if we could move to the next slide um first of all we we are

386
0:37:40.160 --> 0:37:48.320
very quickly leading into um probably uh two weeks before we moved into uh level two and level three

387
0:37:48.320 --> 0:37:54.960
before we even knew what that meant uh we had worked very closely with the board around a pandemic plan

388
0:37:54.960 --> 0:37:59.680
how we would operate the business and more importantly started to look at some scenario and modeling

389
0:37:59.680 --> 0:38:05.920
at that point um that and there's Jason would have mentioned earlier on as borders such as China

390
0:38:06.880 --> 0:38:13.600
we're we're closing to tourism we also saw the writing on the ward on the wall for our

391
0:38:13.600 --> 0:38:19.920
aim business so that plan was developed and approved by the board before we even went into lockdown

392
0:38:21.040 --> 0:38:27.120
we've completed significant cost reductions in the business that's right across the business

393
0:38:27.120 --> 0:38:35.600
of its major cost reductions in our fence lines, reductions pretty much across our business

394
0:38:35.600 --> 0:38:42.000
in terms of payroll, anything up to a 20% reduction and the board have also taken a reduction

395
0:38:42.000 --> 0:38:48.560
and their direct defeats um we applied for and received the government wage subsidy across the group

396
0:38:50.000 --> 0:38:54.960
and uh with the hotel we worked through and I still working through with jet park

397
0:38:56.160 --> 0:39:02.000
but they've gone through a full restructuring exercise number of people have been made redundant

398
0:39:02.000 --> 0:39:08.480
and number have been retained under the government subsidy but we have a meeting later this week with

399
0:39:08.480 --> 0:39:14.720
jet park to look at stage two earpour association that we're part of us doing a major piece of work

400
0:39:14.720 --> 0:39:21.520
uh with central government to try and see what our support of any there are for earpour companies

401
0:39:21.520 --> 0:39:28.080
that have been significantly hurt as you know we are we're long-term infrastructure owners

402
0:39:29.040 --> 0:39:35.840
or quite significant capital to maintain the assets um so there's a piece of work going

403
0:39:36.640 --> 0:39:41.600
on in that space really cover the people we can move to the next slide

404
0:39:45.120 --> 0:39:51.600
the scenario modelling that I talk about there um I think the point

405
0:39:52.560 --> 0:39:58.320
that I'll that I'll make here and come back to at the end is that um

406
0:40:00.000 --> 0:40:04.880
most earpour companies particularly regionally airport companies are significantly

407
0:40:04.880 --> 0:40:11.200
hurt and hit now um we are fortunate that um that we've made the decision

408
0:40:11.200 --> 0:40:16.640
our five or six years ago that the board then under under the leadership of John Spencer and

409
0:40:16.640 --> 0:40:23.920
then implemented by myself and my team uh we've we have as you know dive out of the airport

410
0:40:24.640 --> 0:40:32.160
company and that is I guess bought us time so we have completed um a very conservative

411
0:40:32.720 --> 0:40:40.560
model for igen's sake that it assumes no in New Zealand activity of any uh of any meaningful

412
0:40:40.560 --> 0:40:48.960
sense before October this year uh no and then only a recovery of about 40% of passenger numbers

413
0:40:48.960 --> 0:40:58.400
through uh 2021 calendar year um and well into 2022 before we have a positive eve at dar really

414
0:40:59.040 --> 0:41:04.880
so what is and we've also taken a very conservative view of our our

415
0:41:05.840 --> 0:41:13.840
leases of our leases ability to pay us etc no activity out of the hotel really for the balance

416
0:41:13.840 --> 0:41:20.320
of this under year uh so very very uh conservative but realistic modelling

417
0:41:21.280 --> 0:41:28.160
fortunately we have a major land so that is unconditional and uh very extremely good

418
0:41:29.120 --> 0:41:36.240
family uh significant family multinational business that have agreed to further provide

419
0:41:36.240 --> 0:41:42.800
a letter of credit to the airport company which gives me confidence to to build the road so to speak

420
0:41:42.800 --> 0:41:50.480
so um that delivers about two and a half million dollars of of margin of free cash flow

421
0:41:51.120 --> 0:41:57.760
into the group early next year so the reality is that we can get through this year and through the

422
0:41:57.760 --> 0:42:05.680
June 21 almost a slightly positive cash position the balance sheets taken a bit of a hurt and

423
0:42:05.680 --> 0:42:12.400
Scott will take you through that but um and also we have some work going on on central precinct and

424
0:42:12.400 --> 0:42:18.000
again we have the ability hopefully to settle some unconditional land sales with the same degree

425
0:42:18.000 --> 0:42:24.080
of confidence around further charities which will also feed some additional cash into the group

426
0:42:25.040 --> 0:42:33.040
um we've only utilized about 65% of our depth funding and in fact we have further facilities

427
0:42:33.040 --> 0:42:39.200
that we were intending to take anyway pre-covert and we will still take which will take our funding

428
0:42:39.200 --> 0:42:47.280
up to about 30 million and then we will have only utilized not much more than 50% of that by June

429
0:42:47.440 --> 0:42:56.800
next year so most most of the cash burden is is funded out of um at about overdraft during this period

430
0:42:56.800 --> 0:43:05.040
and then the land sales kickback and we're back in positive space, be in safe very supportive

431
0:43:06.080 --> 0:43:12.160
and no no issues there around funding. Next slide please.

432
0:43:12.160 --> 0:43:23.600
So we have joined with Hamilton City and and I have spoken to Gary Diet and others around the

433
0:43:23.600 --> 0:43:29.120
obviously the Crown Infrastructure Projects we have put forward two applications if you've had a

434
0:43:29.120 --> 0:43:37.360
chance to review um the submission machine might would be aware there are 23 projects we have

435
0:43:37.440 --> 0:43:44.800
submitted for the Terminal Redevelopment and also for an amalgam of a number of projects around

436
0:43:44.800 --> 0:43:53.600
the airport that deal with roading lateral infrastructure, our wastewater plant and um various other

437
0:43:54.800 --> 0:44:01.440
aspect that the gain is also worth about 11 million dollars so we have um put those in

438
0:44:01.760 --> 0:44:08.160
with the West successful who knows but under the Terminal Redevelopment project we're ready to go

439
0:44:08.800 --> 0:44:15.040
tenders have been received and and being evaluated the week of lockdown um our consenters in

440
0:44:15.040 --> 0:44:20.400
with what we're in with your council at the moment and that's um well there was well underway so

441
0:44:20.400 --> 0:44:27.040
it is a shovel really project um we could be able to ground um and doing enabling works within a month

442
0:44:27.120 --> 0:44:35.360
of uh a funding line the key for myself and the board will be what are the tags that the government

443
0:44:36.000 --> 0:44:44.080
apply if we are successful to the funding mechanism how much of it is um is the loan is a grant,

444
0:44:44.080 --> 0:44:51.280
etc that's underway and that's part of our recovery program so if we go to the next slide

445
0:44:57.760 --> 0:45:02.720
been important as we've worked through really the devastation of the power through four weeks to

446
0:45:02.720 --> 0:45:09.840
make sure that we still keep our eye on the longer term um for the group and our focus over the next

447
0:45:09.840 --> 0:45:15.520
12 months I won't spend any detailed time here other than to let you know that we have a

448
0:45:16.080 --> 0:45:24.640
a clear set of a clear business plan and a clear set of objectives for FY 2021 um most of

449
0:45:24.640 --> 0:45:31.520
those remain in place we are reviewing them currently as a management team but we are trying to make

450
0:45:31.520 --> 0:45:38.640
sure that um we continue uh property is a major contributor as you can see the effort to

451
0:45:39.680 --> 0:45:47.600
shy bake million dollars in land sales in the next 12 month period um operations we continue to

452
0:45:47.600 --> 0:45:54.160
maintain um the runway fortunately in our 10 year asset management plan we have a very

453
0:45:54.160 --> 0:46:01.040
quite we just spent close to a million dollars uh finishing in March of this year on some

454
0:46:01.040 --> 0:46:07.360
apron works and some pumps uh some other bits and pieces uh but we have a very quite

455
0:46:07.360 --> 0:46:12.480
capital expenditure for era in order to call over the next 12 to 18 months which couldn't have

456
0:46:12.480 --> 0:46:19.040
come at a better time but we maintain the assets and you need to know that we that we uh that we will

457
0:46:19.360 --> 0:46:26.480
um when it comes to we'll be working very closely with Ian Zeland to try and obviously kickstart

458
0:46:28.240 --> 0:46:36.960
services again and so our whole marketing and our social media and con strategy will be around exactly

459
0:46:36.960 --> 0:46:44.800
that. I hope tell us a much more difficult um uh beast is you would have gained from uh Jason's

460
0:46:45.520 --> 0:46:54.160
presentation but look um we uh we are working now closely with Jet Park to understand what a uh

461
0:46:54.160 --> 0:47:01.280
what a plane coming out the other side may look like fortunately it's a hotel uh that wasn't

462
0:47:01.280 --> 0:47:08.960
reliant on international tourism but it is reliant on uh conferencing uh in particular and uh we

463
0:47:08.960 --> 0:47:15.120
we yet to understand the behaviour of the business community as we go forward in this new world so

464
0:47:15.680 --> 0:47:23.360
we have just almost a foot spinning most of four million on the hotel just prior to lockdown um

465
0:47:23.360 --> 0:47:31.120
so uh it is a it's a it's a it's a property that um we're going to have to um maintain in the meantime

466
0:47:31.120 --> 0:47:39.840
in fund and our conservative modelling does um does mean that the group can um fund its interests

467
0:47:39.840 --> 0:47:48.480
in the hotel uh send me for the next 18 months with um limited activity from it and if we move

468
0:47:48.480 --> 0:47:53.600
down to the next slide which is probably uh the financial certain couple of slides here on

469
0:47:54.320 --> 0:48:00.240
on sort of financials and and all it's got to lead and now my our overarching comment here would

470
0:48:00.240 --> 0:48:07.200
be you had a lot of detail in the six month uh interim results so we decided there was no point

471
0:48:07.200 --> 0:48:13.040
in replicating information you will have read so Scott will summarize it here and more importantly

472
0:48:13.040 --> 0:48:18.320
take you out the other side over the couple of years. All right good afternoon everyone and

473
0:48:18.320 --> 0:48:22.880
thanks Matt for the introduction um yeah I went to I'll too much on the past because it's um

474
0:48:22.880 --> 0:48:27.680
unfortunately to become largely irrelevant but I guess just some key takeaways to the slide and

475
0:48:27.680 --> 0:48:32.160
and what you may have read already um an interim report but it's really that my maintain we've

476
0:48:32.160 --> 0:48:37.200
built in the past couple of years around a um sustainable so recurring revenue base through

477
0:48:37.200 --> 0:48:41.680
passenger growth and the year partners through a property portfolio that it continued really well

478
0:48:41.680 --> 0:48:47.760
for the first half of the year um and go obviously without covered in 19 we expected to continue

479
0:48:47.760 --> 0:48:53.600
to the full year and beyond um yeah just some points around property obviously talking um some

480
0:48:53.600 --> 0:48:58.960
big numbers for our land sales I guess that they are land sales that have been contemplated um

481
0:48:58.960 --> 0:49:02.800
under a 10 year plan the land sales and the pipeline it's not something that we've done

482
0:49:02.800 --> 0:49:07.840
as a new direct reaction um also of a five-cell type arrangement just to get some cash from

483
0:49:07.840 --> 0:49:13.280
next couple years these are um the land we're selling is um sort of surplus to your an Oracle

484
0:49:14.240 --> 0:49:18.320
in fact matcha but it's actually physically separated from the airport through a gallery system so

485
0:49:18.320 --> 0:49:24.000
we're not compromising any core assets sort of um future accountability by selling this land

486
0:49:25.040 --> 0:49:30.480
very much as um land it's surplus the airport so it's why it's being sold off um time it has been

487
0:49:31.680 --> 0:49:36.000
um yes just with the hotel obviously it is a new investment for us the new industry and best

488
0:49:36.000 --> 0:49:42.320
sitting um really pleased with the early trading performance um yeah and probably placing that we didn't

489
0:49:42.400 --> 0:49:47.840
others in the initial money to do the property up um the 10-distant deferred maintenance and things

490
0:49:47.840 --> 0:49:53.040
it's actually traded cash flow positive has no to be profitable with the appreciation things but um

491
0:49:54.240 --> 0:49:58.640
fact ranch able to repay some debt and you know the it's the early vital signs of an occupancy

492
0:49:58.640 --> 0:50:03.840
and rem rate have been I've been certainly in lime expectation and again kind of right up until

493
0:50:03.840 --> 0:50:08.320
February March it was really just coming to a stride round the conference center and the food

494
0:50:08.320 --> 0:50:14.640
beverage offerings so yeah um I think you know it was um you know it was looking really positive

495
0:50:14.640 --> 0:50:18.560
um and hopefully you don't yet the other side that's the O-Momington weekend um we can

496
0:50:18.560 --> 0:50:24.080
leverage off the end so I'll just look um look to the future now just to most of the next slide

497
0:50:25.680 --> 0:50:31.680
um please yeah so given here just sort of um and six-month-themed increments um the remainder of the

498
0:50:31.680 --> 0:50:36.240
financial year um also the financial year that we're in and then the following is for a little

499
0:50:36.240 --> 0:50:40.960
presented and the draft statement and the 10-distant received I think I'm important to focus on

500
0:50:40.960 --> 0:50:46.880
the debate because that's sort of a cash flow metric for us um that includes land sales but it

501
0:50:46.880 --> 0:50:52.400
excludes the courses cost like depreciation which um is around three million dollars a year for us

502
0:50:52.400 --> 0:50:58.240
which in the short term um it's not necessarily linear with the within investment we make into

503
0:50:58.240 --> 0:51:05.360
assets so seeing um obviously seeing a reasonably significant decline in the in the next um and

504
0:51:05.360 --> 0:51:11.280
this calendar year with um across the bus and certainly going to suffer and that's um as we see

505
0:51:11.280 --> 0:51:15.200
and that's sort of early six months between the summer 20 and June next year that's

506
0:51:15.200 --> 0:51:21.200
if we've picked a large land sale um taking a fit and then as the bus is kind of gets back on

507
0:51:21.200 --> 0:51:26.560
its feet um you can see it's slowly back to cash flow positive so I guess you want to compare the

508
0:51:26.560 --> 0:51:30.240
read the read and the blue the blue bars and read land and the green light is sort of the within

509
0:51:30.240 --> 0:51:34.960
we're going to head now so you can see it differently the next sort of 15 to 18 months it's

510
0:51:34.960 --> 0:51:40.720
going to be a bit painful um but after that um too much back on our feet and not becoming

511
0:51:40.720 --> 0:51:46.560
heavily reliant on unland sales sitting out past an exciting month so we've only seen what's already

512
0:51:46.560 --> 0:51:51.360
under contract in what's under conditional seatbelt in those numbers so I think that's um the

513
0:51:51.360 --> 0:51:57.600
conservative but realistic and conservative on both fronts um sitting at a cost where looking

514
0:51:57.600 --> 0:52:00.720
to remove out of the bus and there's only anything that's going to compromise a long term

515
0:52:00.720 --> 0:52:05.840
we're not giving out capability but um either we've built a with managed to hang on too

516
0:52:05.840 --> 0:52:10.720
for as long as we have I think there's some um yeah a different conservative and look at things

517
0:52:10.720 --> 0:52:15.680
don't play up the way we see them doing and certainly not as positive as um and what I do

518
0:52:15.680 --> 0:52:21.120
there's some opportunities if um further but for now it's um this sort of as real estate that we can

519
0:52:21.120 --> 0:52:26.960
preserve a current capability anywhere um yeah I guess just overlay the neat profit slide

520
0:52:27.760 --> 0:52:32.480
yeah there's a lot more um probably that the deficits are bigger largely because of the

521
0:52:32.480 --> 0:52:38.480
affected appreciation but ultimately following a fairly similar trend of the cash flow that um

522
0:52:39.040 --> 0:52:44.400
look land sales over the next 18 months will give us um cash flow positive and we expect by

523
0:52:44.400 --> 0:52:48.960
the in the bus and to be largely cash flow positive from its recurring trading to be sustainable

524
0:52:50.400 --> 0:52:56.640
and yeah that's probably I guess um the main takeaway there and it's not really built into the

525
0:52:56.640 --> 0:53:00.800
slides but just um it's marked all about the fit on the balance sheet look we expect that there

526
0:53:00.800 --> 0:53:05.280
will be some impacts so a balance sheet around property values and those sort of equally

527
0:53:05.280 --> 0:53:11.360
movements um so as a shareholder that obviously will impact your accounts as well but um I guess

528
0:53:11.360 --> 0:53:16.880
out of this is as a as a shareholder and a non financial sense um um animal list we're preserving

529
0:53:16.880 --> 0:53:23.200
our core capability um we're not compromising any of our numerical capability um I think yeah in terms

530
0:53:23.200 --> 0:53:27.200
of what the service will keep delivering um that shouldn't be compromised or at least our

531
0:53:27.200 --> 0:53:32.240
ability to do it um that was really well our head just um they have a view of the financials

532
0:53:32.240 --> 0:53:37.840
so it might be perfect to map to wrap up. This is their last slide um my apologies it's

533
0:53:37.840 --> 0:53:43.840
it's certainly taken a bit of your time but look I think the key themes here really are as I opened

534
0:53:44.560 --> 0:53:54.400
we we we we um hit this situation in a very strong position um and uh in a very strong balance sheet

535
0:53:55.680 --> 0:54:02.480
a record year um the foresight of the diversification through our 10-year group strategy um

536
0:54:02.480 --> 0:54:08.880
here's I think really bought this company time uh perhaps unlike some other regionally

537
0:54:08.880 --> 0:54:15.600
reports that I think we'll need to go to the shareholders very uh quickly for additional funding

538
0:54:15.600 --> 0:54:23.280
or through the of through their bank funding lines um we don't need to um that non-revenue has been

539
0:54:23.280 --> 0:54:32.960
absolutely critical to to and in fact ironically we never predict of a COVID-19 scenario but we

540
0:54:33.040 --> 0:54:41.600
did predict um a loss of erinordical income uh through um cessation of services or reduced services so

541
0:54:43.360 --> 0:54:53.120
has been one of the same uh and look um overall um the recovery's Scott has mentioned will be modest

542
0:54:53.680 --> 0:55:02.160
but sustainable um and as I want to keep restating uh we won't need to go to our core debt at this stage

543
0:55:03.120 --> 0:55:10.320
or funding lines to to to fund us we can fund it um uh out of uh in effect the working capital

544
0:55:10.960 --> 0:55:17.760
um and most importantly I think for you as the shareholder's there is no requirement for the board

545
0:55:17.760 --> 0:55:25.440
to come to a shareholders for support and we don't see a scenario at all that um that requires

546
0:55:25.520 --> 0:55:32.640
a shareholder's to assist the poor company um in the foreseeable future so that's it from me

547
0:55:32.640 --> 0:55:38.720
sorry Andrew I apologize that we're over time but um have you to take questions if you've got time?

548
0:55:38.720 --> 0:55:45.840
Yeah no thanks guys um I think we were aware that um a bit of extra time was going to be required

549
0:55:45.840 --> 0:55:52.800
for you guys with uh such a mess of impact um I just got a quick question about the flight school um

550
0:55:53.760 --> 0:55:58.080
would they not get back to level one or possibly could they operate a level two?

551
0:55:58.880 --> 0:56:04.320
Uh well in fact Scott's just had some advice today it could well be that the pilots that are

552
0:56:04.320 --> 0:56:10.000
are well through their qualification will be able to start flying under level three so as soon as

553
0:56:10.000 --> 0:56:16.720
next week we could see some flight activity um but it will be to your point Andrew down at level one

554
0:56:16.720 --> 0:56:21.680
probably but there'll be the social distancing issues when you have an instructor

555
0:56:21.760 --> 0:56:29.520
and a trainee pilot on board so I think we're still around clear and so are L3 as to when that will be

556
0:56:30.640 --> 0:56:37.200
um I think it's worth noting that um we don't quite know where we're going to go over the L3

557
0:56:37.200 --> 0:56:41.520
in the sense that they've got a hundred about a hundred and eighty pilots currently um at the

558
0:56:42.480 --> 0:56:51.040
Hamilton or out at the accommodation at um at the airport so I think we were far out there

559
0:56:51.040 --> 0:56:55.680
fine for the next few months the question is how whether they're going to be the logistics of

560
0:56:55.680 --> 0:57:03.840
moving pilots across borders for training and actually pilots uh there is not a death of pilots

561
0:57:03.840 --> 0:57:10.560
in the global marketplace as a result of the catastrophe catastrophe for the airlines so I think those

562
0:57:10.560 --> 0:57:18.240
two would suggest to us that um we've got difficult times ahead past the end of 2020 with L3

563
0:57:19.920 --> 0:57:29.680
yeah they make sense um yeah I think um it's as you've both noted um the stage that you

564
0:57:29.680 --> 0:57:36.640
you're at with your um property development has has been a very fortunate thing of if this had

565
0:57:36.720 --> 0:57:42.320
occurred at the at the beginning of that it would have been far more um financially destructive

566
0:57:42.320 --> 0:57:49.920
but does anybody else have any queries? Okay that not been case look thank you very much I

567
0:57:49.920 --> 0:57:58.400
have a really comprehensive update and um great to see um you recovered from the shock and um

568
0:57:58.400 --> 0:58:03.680
being really positive and and uh constructive going forward so thanks very much to you both

569
0:58:04.640 --> 0:58:11.680
thanks thank you everyone thank you thank you I think it is and I see we have killed and

570
0:58:11.680 --> 0:58:22.800
I suppose sorry what was that? Ah okay so we got Kelvin and also as Peter available

571
0:58:22.800 --> 0:58:31.280
yes I am oh great so thanks Kelvin and Peter and we'll fit you get onto the

572
0:58:31.920 --> 0:58:38.320
um sheet services. Thanks Mr Chairman and thanks for the opportunity to speak with you the

573
0:58:38.320 --> 0:58:43.280
South and the Nurn you've been provided with a copy of the company statement of intent and

574
0:58:43.920 --> 0:58:49.840
half yearly report to 31 December 2019 and I I'm conscious of the fact this is the first opportunity

575
0:58:49.840 --> 0:58:58.320
they have had is the newest chair of the last two talk to you so I wanted to start by just briefly

576
0:58:58.320 --> 0:59:03.600
introducing myself and then I wanted to talk a little bit about the company's transformation role

577
0:59:04.800 --> 0:59:08.880
how are we going to do things differently what it means for your council and then I want to

578
0:59:08.880 --> 0:59:15.760
conclude with some remarks about Covid-19 but I guess the key point is that certainly from the

579
0:59:15.760 --> 0:59:22.960
board of last perspective the organisation has never been more relevant than it will be in a post

580
0:59:23.600 --> 0:59:31.280
Covid-19 recovery period so the first point I wanted to make is that my family has been heavily

581
0:59:31.280 --> 0:59:37.440
invested in the White Cutter for a very long time my mother's family came to this region in 1865

582
0:59:38.640 --> 0:59:43.680
my father's family came to this region in 1880s and all my family live in the region my mum

583
0:59:43.680 --> 0:59:49.600
lives in Hureki district my sister lives in Thames Coromandle I have another sister in Hamilton

584
0:59:50.240 --> 0:59:57.440
a brother in White Park district and after 44 years and she and I are leaving Auckland next week

585
0:59:58.000 --> 1:00:04.080
and moving to Cambridge so we very much look forward to becoming a White Park district council

586
1:00:04.080 --> 1:00:11.520
rate payers as from the 1st of May so as you can see my family's been heavily invested in the

587
1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:16.080
success of the region and it's one of the reasons I took the job that the other reason is the

588
1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:22.160
clarity of the opportunity and I've spent 21 years in local government governance across multiple

589
1:00:22.160 --> 1:00:29.280
CCOs and clarity of role is actually quite unusual in this case the company's version is to have

590
1:00:29.280 --> 1:00:34.320
White Cutter or Council's working together in the best way possible for the collective benefit

591
1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:39.600
of their man their communities which means less burden on rate payers happy our communities

592
1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:47.040
and Council's staff and more effective councils so as we've set out in our statement of intent

593
1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:52.960
the organization really exists to do three things first of all to create effectiveness and

594
1:00:52.960 --> 1:00:59.440
efficiency gains for shareholders such as you second lead to help increase the influence of the region

595
1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:04.480
and third lead to help shareholders provide a better customer experience

596
1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:13.120
what less does is provide an opportunity to think regionally without boundaries and to then help

597
1:01:13.120 --> 1:01:20.560
councils use that thing locally to improve the well-being of the community so thinking regionally

598
1:01:20.560 --> 1:01:24.880
means that rather than individual councils trying to solve their problems individually

599
1:01:25.440 --> 1:01:30.960
less can help them work them out with the cost of that spread while still allowing local

600
1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:38.000
choices to whether to implement solutions locally. I think that it's fair to say my observation

601
1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:42.720
would be that over the years of its existence the organization's done a good job but I think

602
1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:47.360
one of the reasons that I've been high is that there was an opportunity seen to be able to

603
1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:54.720
really grasp the company's potential so when I was high the board said that it wanted to undertake

604
1:01:54.720 --> 1:02:01.760
a number of transformative projects at pace and for that reason we are going to end our driving

605
1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:08.960
the organization harder and faster and earlier this year the board committed to do just that.

606
1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:15.680
We are looking to be bolder, more disruptive to enable you to help you transform

607
1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:23.440
how you and other Wacca tool councils operate. We also want the afraid of failing and by that I mean

608
1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:30.080
recognising the opportunities worth pursuing as long as we do it fast. Coming from the

609
1:02:30.080 --> 1:02:34.160
private sector having spent 35 years in the private sector my observation would be that

610
1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:37.920
there's nothing wrong with failure as long as you fail fast and fail cheap.

611
1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:45.680
So with that in mind and looking ahead over the next 18 months there are really three core

612
1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:50.240
elements to what we're doing. There are some key strategic projects which we'll be looking to

613
1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:54.000
advance as fast as possible and you'll see those projects in the statement of a team.

614
1:02:55.520 --> 1:03:02.240
There are some businesses' usual projects and in addition I've asked for a re-examination of

615
1:03:02.240 --> 1:03:04.960
some of the work that we're doing to see whether we should stop doing it.

616
1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:13.280
As you'll appreciate it it's really fundamental to perceptions of success of an organization

617
1:03:13.280 --> 1:03:18.560
that they seem to be making progress month by month. So one of the things we've done is introduced

618
1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:23.440
a lot more careful tracking about what it is that we're doing and whether we're being successful

619
1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:27.120
and we're looking to improve the communications to key council staff as well.

620
1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:34.480
I've set to my board colleagues and you'll be aware on sure that everyone sits around the

621
1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:39.840
last board with the exception of me as a chief executive of one of the member councils.

622
1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:45.200
I've set to my board colleagues that they are really the difference between last succeeding and failing

623
1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:48.880
and the reason for that is that they are the ones who will dictate the

624
1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:53.840
resourcing and prioritisation and cooperation which is a quarter to less projects.

625
1:03:54.240 --> 1:03:59.360
And I'll be the point pretty clearly that without their total commitment the organization will fail,

626
1:03:59.360 --> 1:04:04.320
but equally their success, lesser success will be their success and vice versa.

627
1:04:05.920 --> 1:04:09.600
So turning now to what means for your council.

628
1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:17.040
Think three things. First of all you should consider this organization as an extension of your

629
1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:22.640
vision of building the future together to promote the well-being of wipe our district and its people.

630
1:04:23.920 --> 1:04:29.680
We've both got a role to play in providing solutions to the high growth region of the wipe

631
1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:36.000
hotel. We both recognise the need to do more with less to drive cost out of local councils.

632
1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:41.680
We both want to ensure that nationally the wipe hotel region punches of

633
1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:48.000
babbits wait by showing that the region can provide joint up services across the region.

634
1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:54.560
And we both want to improve the well-bealing of the community. Indeed it's in your vision.

635
1:04:56.240 --> 1:05:00.960
Secondly as an organization as I've said before we're not limited by boundaries we're tasked with

636
1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:07.680
thinking regionally to enable you to act better locally. And I think the opportunities to work with

637
1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:11.520
you and your companion councils to achieve your aspirations are boundless,

638
1:05:12.160 --> 1:05:20.000
regardless and possibly even more bit close off COVID-19. Thirdly obviously by necessity we need

639
1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:25.360
resource to achieve our outcomes and you'll see that some of the initiatives that we've proposed

640
1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:29.680
in the statement of intent will require some upfront investment in order to achieve some

641
1:05:29.680 --> 1:05:36.080
mid-to-long-term savings. Now I said I would finish with a few words on coronavirus.

642
1:05:36.080 --> 1:05:41.280
It won't surprise you to know that as a board we've discussed very early on whether we should

643
1:05:41.280 --> 1:05:46.400
make any substantive changes to our work program to reflect what will be a new reality.

644
1:05:47.600 --> 1:05:52.560
What we concluded indeed was that in fact we should keep doing what we're doing because it's

645
1:05:52.560 --> 1:05:59.120
going to be even more important. Moreover it's going to help rebuild the region and increase resilience

646
1:06:00.400 --> 1:06:05.760
our view is that in a post COVID-19 period during the recovery period there'll be need in the

647
1:06:05.760 --> 1:06:11.920
region for at least the following three things. First security of public works to enable a

648
1:06:11.920 --> 1:06:17.600
private sector to plan long range and I think importantly commit to training and for this staff

649
1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:24.160
to commit the stay in the region. Secondly a demonstration of restraint by public bodies on

650
1:06:24.160 --> 1:06:28.880
what might be perceived as non-essential spending in other words doing more with less.

651
1:06:29.680 --> 1:06:34.880
And thirdly motivation and encouragement and development of current counselor staff.

652
1:06:35.920 --> 1:06:41.200
Now we're planning to deliver all of those already through our work program has set out on the

653
1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:48.480
statement of intent. So thank you for the opportunity to talk to you. I obviously wish that I could

654
1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:56.240
have spoken with you in person but now doubt that opportunity will arise sometime shortly in the future.

655
1:06:56.320 --> 1:07:01.440
Calvin and I are more than happy to take any questions Mr Chair but I wondered Calvin if there

656
1:07:01.440 --> 1:07:08.640
is any additional points that you want to make? Well, Calvin Peter, thank you.

657
1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:18.560
Okay thanks very much for that. As you mentioned the last has been active in our

658
1:07:19.520 --> 1:07:28.640
20 accounts for a number of years now and been very successful, particularly with Rata, the

659
1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:38.800
roading accord but what's happening now is an absolute step change and I totally agree with what

660
1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:49.680
you said about it being more important post-COVID rather than less. So yeah, I wish we have a success

661
1:07:49.680 --> 1:07:59.200
of course. Now questions I think clear yes. Yeah thanks Andrew and I'd great to

662
1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:06.560
our next new advisor and it's with C2 Calvin. I did see through some questions that I'm two

663
1:08:07.520 --> 1:08:15.760
ones that I'd just like to ask in this forum. The first one is that you've made a strong case for

664
1:08:16.400 --> 1:08:21.360
continuing how you're going at the moment. You know that all those things that you're focusing on

665
1:08:21.360 --> 1:08:26.240
will be more important than ever when we're dealing in the post-COVID era, I guess.

666
1:08:27.120 --> 1:08:33.840
But a lot of the things that are done that rely on the B, I suppose the goodwill account some

667
1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:41.280
of the ideas and releasing resources from their business to work on less stuff and I can

668
1:08:41.280 --> 1:08:46.640
foresee that Councils are actually going to be pretty hard pressed with their own

669
1:08:46.640 --> 1:08:52.000
own staffing resources dealing with extra things that have come out of the woodwork to do with

670
1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:58.240
COVID-19 and so what assurance can you give us that you won't sort of find yourself

671
1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:03.600
behind that you can't get that sort of resource that you do need from the individual

672
1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:08.320
Councils that have normally been really supportive because you know you're so I can just

673
1:09:08.320 --> 1:09:15.200
completely committed to this other work. Calvin would you mind if I answer that question first

674
1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:20.000
and then, John, maybe there's a few additional points you want to make. I think Councilor,

675
1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:27.680
thank you that's a great question. The good news is we had I'm happy to say thought of that as well

676
1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:35.200
and one of the earliest things that we did well before lockdown was when we could see this thing coming.

677
1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:42.480
It was to reach out to Councils to listen to think about whether in the context of any redeployment

678
1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:46.960
of assets and people that they were doing, whether there were going to be some people that might

679
1:09:46.960 --> 1:09:53.040
in fact be freed up to be able to work on some of our projects to make them go faster.

680
1:09:53.680 --> 1:09:59.120
And I was pleasantly surprised particularly from some of the smaller councils to be honest,

681
1:09:59.840 --> 1:10:07.120
about the positive response that we got in terms of offering up staff. That's a first point.

682
1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:13.040
The second point is that more specifically, Calvin's been in touch with the chief executives

683
1:10:13.040 --> 1:10:18.720
of all of the councils I think is recently as yesterday, Calvin, where we've set out some

684
1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:23.440
specific skill sets that we're looking for in order to be able to advance some of our strategic projects.

685
1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:31.680
So, as I say, a great question surprisingly repositive response from the councils that we've

686
1:10:31.680 --> 1:10:38.320
reached out to, but you're absolutely right. The resourcing issue may even flow over time and

687
1:10:38.320 --> 1:10:43.120
it's something we're acutely conscious of. Calvin, did you have any points to add?

688
1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:47.840
I think that sort of covers the rule of paper to be honest.

689
1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:57.120
Well, that's really encouraging actually. It's good to get that clarification that's great.

690
1:10:57.120 --> 1:11:02.320
Now the question I had was about the energy and carbon management that's mentioned in the

691
1:11:02.320 --> 1:11:09.440
East Side here. I wasn't sure whether that is the carbon order that our councilors sort of

692
1:11:09.440 --> 1:11:15.280
before the last election. There was one of the directions that we gave staff that we wanted

693
1:11:15.280 --> 1:11:21.120
to get something organized and that which would help us. I suppose formulated a plan, you know,

694
1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:26.320
for climate change in that. And this is the energy management that's mentioned that that

695
1:11:26.320 --> 1:11:31.440
may have started. Is that feeding into that order or not?

696
1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:38.960
The short answer is Councillor that knows. Well, it's certainly not the order that you all

697
1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:49.840
refer into. I don't see any particular reason why the people that we use to that we engage to provide

698
1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:55.600
that support to councils could not help with that order if that was something that the

699
1:11:55.600 --> 1:12:01.840
white part executive team were interested in doing. But I'm not actually

700
1:12:01.840 --> 1:12:06.400
probably to the particular, the status of the particular piece of work that you're referring to.

701
1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:14.240
I know that Martin Lynch, who's one of the guys that tends to work with white part

702
1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:21.600
district council, has been doing some the spike work in this area, but I'm not sure whether it's

703
1:12:21.600 --> 1:12:27.680
specifically relates to that report that you're referring to. Okay, I'll well, thanks thanks for the clarification.

704
1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:39.200
Okay, any more questions? No, okay, well, I take you very much for that presentation. And

705
1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:47.360
yeah, particularly now in a period of significant change, that's really great to see the

706
1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:53.360
positivity. We have gone forward even with the weird will we have around a certain moment. So,

707
1:12:53.360 --> 1:13:02.000
yeah, thanks Peter Kelvin very much. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Yes. And I see Andrew Michael is

708
1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:10.080
available and we'll talk to us about the LGFA. Thank you for the opportunity. I'll just maybe make

709
1:13:10.080 --> 1:13:15.200
a few brief comments and then touch on the current environment and then leave some time for

710
1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:25.200
full questions. So, LGFA started in 2012 that currently has 60, 7 member councils,

711
1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:30.640
were the number of others in the process of joining. And the current environment has probably just

712
1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:37.040
even for the councils that don't have any depth. They realise that having access to finances

713
1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:45.120
importance, that's probably speeding up there. They're time table for joining. LGFA

714
1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:51.280
is based on similar models in the Scandinavian countries, the longest of those, there's an

715
1:13:51.280 --> 1:13:59.520
dimat that's been going for 130 years now. So, what LGFA wants is to be a very long term provider

716
1:13:59.520 --> 1:14:06.960
of financing to the local authority sector. The objectives are interest savings on councils

717
1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:13.440
debt to provide a range of borrowing options. So, short term and longer term financing. And probably

718
1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:20.000
the most important one is access to debt markets. And that's been the area that's picked

719
1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:23.040
in the most challenging going over the past couple of months.

720
1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:36.160
In terms of the financials, the profit for the year to join 2020, which was forecast to be 10 million

721
1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:44.880
is on tracks, or even ran the part numbers for April yesterday. And again, the monthly profit

722
1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:53.600
is on track. A lot of the forecasting that's in the draft, SOS, just our data, it's just been

723
1:14:53.600 --> 1:15:00.240
super seeded by the events that we've seen the last few months. But that said, just remember that

724
1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:06.080
LGFA has $10 billion of lending to the sector. So, we borrow from investors and on lending

725
1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:12.480
that nearly time we do, we take a small margin. So, the profit really on all that lending is locked

726
1:15:12.480 --> 1:15:22.480
and until those loans mature. So, even though the may will be some variability in profit,

727
1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:31.680
a lot of it is locked in. That said, the profitability probably shouldn't be your primary concern

728
1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:38.560
that as we're councils get the savings, as the savings on the interest costs and suitment

729
1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:45.920
to your own accessing of finance. So, that's probably the key then. The current environment

730
1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:53.680
interest rates are low, so maybe that's one little bit of good use for councils. So,

731
1:15:53.680 --> 1:15:58.320
short-term interest rates, councils like yourself can borrow below 1% now.

732
1:15:58.400 --> 1:16:11.920
Long-term, we just completed a $1 billion data show just over a week ago. So, we borrowed for

733
1:16:11.920 --> 1:16:20.800
six years and we borrowed at 1.46% for a billion dollars. So, we will add on 20 points to councils

734
1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:26.480
or 25 points to wipe our competitors. So, you'd be accessing long-term money, six year money

735
1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:35.520
at around 1.7% just to give you some idea of a borrowing cost. So, that's one but a good news.

736
1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:43.760
Probably two or three weeks ago, we were receiving recall borrowing requests from councils.

737
1:16:43.760 --> 1:16:50.160
There's a lot of councils knowing that maybe, you know, fee income is dropping and they needed to

738
1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:56.240
get more money into to cover that. So, we've never had a month. We've had a higher amount of borrowing

739
1:16:56.240 --> 1:17:08.560
costs. LGFA was the first non-government entity. Well, entity other than the government to issue

740
1:17:09.920 --> 1:17:18.240
in New Zealand since the level four lockdown was imposed. For a while, investors were very reluctant

741
1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:23.440
to invest. It's just, you know, they're worried, even if we buy it, we won't be able to sell things

742
1:17:24.320 --> 1:17:32.800
in the such that whole risk of version. That we had two developments. One was LGFA have a $1 billion

743
1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:39.520
standby facility from the New Zealand government that expires next year. But the minister of

744
1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:46.320
revite finance provider the letter to LGFA saying that the government would roll that over

745
1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:53.120
for a few of the period of time. So, that support from the government was just a, it's really

746
1:17:53.120 --> 1:17:58.880
symbolic to investors that there's going to be that ongoing support from the government for LGFA.

747
1:18:00.080 --> 1:18:04.720
The second thing that occurred is the Reserve Bank announced that they were going to buy back

748
1:18:04.720 --> 1:18:11.360
government bonds are subsequent to that. They added LGFA to be listed securities that they're

749
1:18:11.360 --> 1:18:20.240
able to buy. So, they signal that by back up to $3 billion of LGFA bonds from investors. And

750
1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:25.120
it was that that really gave the confidence to investors that if we buy them, there's actually

751
1:18:25.120 --> 1:18:32.240
going to be another huge buyer in the market for that. So, again, you know, the level of support that

752
1:18:32.240 --> 1:18:40.320
we're getting from the government has been extremely important. There's going to be

753
1:18:40.960 --> 1:18:48.800
significant challenges for councils, particularly in the 2021 sort of financial year.

754
1:18:49.520 --> 1:18:57.520
Part of the working group that DIA running, looking at doing a lot of modeling on council financial

755
1:18:57.520 --> 1:19:04.160
performance. This, well, for the remainder of this year and next year and that's feeding them to

756
1:19:04.160 --> 1:19:09.280
a lot of the other government sort of workstream, such as the recovery sort of workstream. So,

757
1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:17.520
there's some quite sobering reading come out of there. For WIPA, you're probably well-positioned

758
1:19:17.520 --> 1:19:25.280
in terms of your debt levels, not high relative to some of the other higher growth councils in

759
1:19:26.320 --> 1:19:33.040
New Zealand. So, yeah, there are a lot of challenges and that's probably one of the challenges

760
1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:40.240
for us is that potentially we're going to get breaches of the financial covenants in the next financial

761
1:19:40.240 --> 1:19:46.400
year, not the financial year. So, today we've never had a breach of the any of the financial

762
1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:53.040
covenants, but you know, if revenue falls significantly for councils where a large amount of debt

763
1:19:53.040 --> 1:20:00.880
to start with, then they could well breach that net debt to revenue covenants. So, that's something

764
1:20:00.880 --> 1:20:07.840
we'll have to deal with. But for those growth councils, you know, one of the last tools that

765
1:20:07.840 --> 1:20:13.360
really got us, you know, having to cut their capex and again, that's not particularly conducive

766
1:20:13.360 --> 1:20:19.280
to starting growth and the economy and us, we can get the Lorda bit about what the government wants

767
1:20:19.280 --> 1:20:27.840
to achieve. So, I'd just like to, you know, we appreciate that there's no compulsion for councils

768
1:20:27.920 --> 1:20:33.520
to use LGFA. You're still free to borrow from any other sources that you want. So, I'd just

769
1:20:33.520 --> 1:20:40.000
like to acknowledge our cannabis team because Waipa was one of the yearly supporters of LGFA.

770
1:20:40.560 --> 1:20:47.120
We very much value your support of us and, you know, the professional relationship that we have.

771
1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:55.680
Thanks, Andrew. I think, yeah, almost goes without saying, but I'll say it anybody

772
1:20:55.680 --> 1:21:05.440
LGFA is going to another great contributor to the local government, seen genuinely and certainly,

773
1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:13.120
well, I guess Waipa hasn't used your services that greatly, we certainly intend to in the future,

774
1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:19.120
possibly even more with COVID, possibly not, we don't know yet, do we can?

775
1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:29.840
Yeah, it's true, we don't know about, but very comforted by the item, by that 1.7% number,

776
1:21:30.480 --> 1:21:35.680
Andrew, it's on, yeah, that is very well priced and borrowing ability.

777
1:21:37.680 --> 1:21:43.600
I like the one that was below 1% even better, but short to possibly isn't us, that much.

778
1:21:44.320 --> 1:21:47.600
Now, where I think, Andrew, does anyone else have any questions?

779
1:21:49.120 --> 1:21:54.640
Bruce, and then clear. You're still muted, Bruce.

780
1:21:58.320 --> 1:21:59.440
Press the space bar.

781
1:22:04.560 --> 1:22:06.480
All right, I need to keep pressing it, mate.

782
1:22:07.440 --> 1:22:12.880
Oh, okay, I'm learning. 5 change machines, one doesn't work, so one's in the bin soon.

783
1:22:13.840 --> 1:22:20.560
Andrew just owns plain study's free share in cabinol. One has, Waipa has got 200,000 shares at

784
1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:26.800
quite 4% just a simple one. Malewa District have got double hours, but at 9.9, over percent.

785
1:22:26.800 --> 1:22:27.760
Would you explain that?

786
1:22:28.080 --> 1:22:39.200
Yes, the share holding is just something sort of historical. So, when LJFA was started, it needed

787
1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:48.320
25 million of equity. So, there was, I think, 9 or 10 councils that were the initial subscribers,

788
1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:56.720
and then they, onsold, some of the issues to a second group of councils that came in is shareholders.

789
1:22:58.400 --> 1:23:05.280
So, LJFA pay a small dividend to councils on their shareholder.

790
1:23:06.800 --> 1:23:13.280
That is 2% over a cost of funds, but our cost of funds might only be like 1.5% at the moment.

791
1:23:13.840 --> 1:23:18.720
So, on a hundred thousand dollars a share is your only going to be getting like the

792
1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:26.560
three or four thousand dollar dividend. So, that is really not material. So, the level of equity

793
1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:34.080
you have is really not that important. It is the savings that you get on your borrowing costs

794
1:23:34.080 --> 1:23:41.280
that are going to be the big drivers of why councils should be members of LJFA.

795
1:23:41.280 --> 1:23:47.280
So, it really doesn't give you a lot of advantage over a council bit as a non-shareholder,

796
1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:52.480
because again, that is still getting the same borrowing benefits that you are.

797
1:23:52.480 --> 1:23:58.160
It is just simply a fact we needed some councils to put in some equity to get the thing off

798
1:23:58.160 --> 1:24:02.160
off the ground. So, again, you know, grateful for the councils that did that.

799
1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:09.440
I think it is just a double-ing of figure and being an ordinary terms and thinking,

800
1:24:09.440 --> 1:24:11.680
well, how did you get to that, so I know, thank you.

801
1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:18.240
I just I just worked at the App for your Bruce. It's a rounding thing. It's actually

802
1:24:18.240 --> 1:24:27.040
got 0.444 of a perceived and when you double-ed you get 0.88. So, it's just rounding up and down.

803
1:24:28.080 --> 1:24:31.760
Thank you Mr. Chair. So, an honour to all. Clear.

804
1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:39.680
Yeah, thanks. I wish I had as about LJFA saying one of the principles is that

805
1:24:39.680 --> 1:24:45.120
they'll demonstrate social and environmental responsibility. And one question that I've been asking

806
1:24:45.120 --> 1:24:52.480
in past is, will LJFA consider introducing something like green financing or environmental bonds,

807
1:24:52.480 --> 1:24:58.240
you know, like the productivity commission did reports to a low-emissions economy,

808
1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:02.720
you know, a couple of years ago. The highlighted that actually is a bit of a gap.

809
1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:09.120
And New Zealand with this kind of financing where councils could borrow for a project that would be,

810
1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:15.360
you know, reducing emissions or for environmental outcomes. And usually it's sort of a slight margin

811
1:25:15.360 --> 1:25:20.560
lease or something just to say it's a good thing to be doing and we want to encourage councils.

812
1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:25.360
Do you think LJFA would do that or are you talking to government about that?

813
1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:30.560
I think you for that question. It is the whole environmental

814
1:25:32.320 --> 1:25:37.040
issues have been pushed a little bit to the back at the moment because we're getting that's going on.

815
1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:45.600
But LJFA is done a significant amount of work on that and we are intending to offer green

816
1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:53.920
financing to councils. So remembering that it's not LJFA that is doing things with the money.

817
1:25:53.920 --> 1:26:02.160
We're just on leaning us, we're sort of middle. We've actually got all the documents up and

818
1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:09.280
ready to go. But the issue is we're going to need councils to identify green projects.

819
1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:16.560
And then also the street care Greece with this green social and sustainable. So for example, a lot

820
1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:22.320
of the water things actually come under sustainable. So there's a whole industry around that and

821
1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:29.600
it involves identifying things and also there's a certification process of done that. So

822
1:26:29.760 --> 1:26:35.440
a couple of weeks after a day on this topic because if you see the documents, they

823
1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:42.640
must be like a hundred pages long and we've got all that really to go. So it is all happening,

824
1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:48.560
but it will be, it's not going to be compulsory or be up to each council is to tell they use that.

825
1:26:49.520 --> 1:26:57.920
But green investing is a big thing globally, probably particularly in Europe, probably less so

826
1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:06.480
in the US. But suddenly it does give you better access to debt markets if you can at the

827
1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:12.160
green framework. I'm thrilled to hear that you're working on an IH to get you should report on that

828
1:27:12.160 --> 1:27:17.760
so that you're actually preparing or you know, working on a proposal because I think a lot of people

829
1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:22.800
would be looking for that and yeah just say, well congratulations are I think it's great that you

830
1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:28.640
you've made years some I suppose. So groundwork progress and we are looking forward to seeing

831
1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:34.960
you know when you can actually make an announcement. Yeah we don't flat we have a council day

832
1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:40.000
year sort of in July and we don't flag that it was something we intend to do. So we would you know

833
1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:46.080
give the update again this year. But it does something that's definitely happening and we're more

834
1:27:46.080 --> 1:27:51.680
than happy to come and speak to you if you want to have you know more and be discussion about

835
1:27:51.680 --> 1:28:00.640
that side of the business. Thank you. Thanks. Any other questions for Andrew?

836
1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:10.400
No, okay there being a case thank you very much for zooming with us and yeah always got

837
1:28:10.400 --> 1:28:15.360
what see you in place one of these days. Yeah no please okay thanks very much.

838
1:28:15.360 --> 1:28:23.760
Cheers. Okay well thanks for that everybody we have a recommendation that runs from A to G

839
1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:31.280
I'm not even going to attempt to read them all out. I'm sure you can. Yeah sorry Andrew probably

840
1:28:31.280 --> 1:28:37.120
the thing we just need to tune our tension too because obviously a key part of that series of

841
1:28:37.200 --> 1:28:43.600
recommendations is the three letters that are in them and the appendices of appendix some

842
1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:49.920
appendix four five and six. So I do just wonder with just before you before you put the

843
1:28:49.920 --> 1:28:57.600
recommendation we've read us just with just seeking any any input into those three letters

844
1:28:57.600 --> 1:29:03.680
because obviously when you do put the recommendation you will be essentially locking in those

845
1:29:04.400 --> 1:29:11.280
the artex for that can you you're very right I did think of that. I read through them and I

846
1:29:11.280 --> 1:29:17.600
I felt they've seen pretty appropriate as they are because particularly with

847
1:29:20.400 --> 1:29:25.520
of course mind back there particularly with the airport we acknowledge that there was going to be

848
1:29:25.520 --> 1:29:31.040
a major revision in there when they're so why but yeah is there anyone does anyone have any

849
1:29:31.760 --> 1:29:38.800
thoughts on a note or good thanks for that Ken but I think we're all good so

850
1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:47.920
um could I have a move please thank you Bruce and the seconder thanks Lou Cheers

851
1:29:49.040 --> 1:29:59.360
all in favour. All right country no it's carried okay moving on to item number nine

852
1:30:00.240 --> 1:30:03.760
and I see notice there Ken did you want to introduce or

853
1:30:05.120 --> 1:30:10.240
note look I'm very heterogeneity this some two to no matter to um to take and through them the

854
1:30:10.240 --> 1:30:16.480
financial report um yeah I guess the only thing I'm of significance in again there is a

855
1:30:16.480 --> 1:30:20.800
health warning there a little bit like I'm like the four monthly report that you saw at the last

856
1:30:20.800 --> 1:30:28.320
council meeting and obviously anything in the item and the forecast column is um yeah as obviously

857
1:30:28.320 --> 1:30:34.880
outdated by the young by the COVID events so yeah so um a huge effort here's um gone on right

858
1:30:34.880 --> 1:30:39.600
across some cross-couts on the last and the last two or three weeks um to um yeah to

859
1:30:39.600 --> 1:30:44.080
refore cast and you should see the results of the refore cast and you should have a

860
1:30:44.080 --> 1:30:49.360
obviously a quite a different um four cast column in the next um financial report you see

861
1:30:49.360 --> 1:30:53.680
but yeah but look we'll see it they see down the happy format of to take us through the report

862
1:30:54.320 --> 1:31:02.880
all right thanks very much thanks Ken good afternoon everyone so at the currently

863
1:31:02.880 --> 1:31:10.080
standing at the end of March the total income is currently at 74% of the forecast

864
1:31:10.080 --> 1:31:19.360
and the operating expenditure is at 72% of the four year forecast we have vested assets of

865
1:31:19.440 --> 1:31:27.840
a living point eight million recognised to date and that's currently 94% of the forecast

866
1:31:28.400 --> 1:31:37.120
discovered assets is 402,000 um development and reserve contributions

867
1:31:39.120 --> 1:31:48.080
of 4.4 million have been received to date and subsidizing grants at 47% of the forecast

868
1:31:50.320 --> 1:31:57.840
um we have capital expenditure today of 71.3 million which is 51% of the forecast

869
1:31:59.840 --> 1:32:07.600
and they have been no major budget changes this month due to refore casting happening now

870
1:32:09.200 --> 1:32:16.640
there was one arbitrage arrangement made on the 12th March that utilize six million dollars

871
1:32:16.720 --> 1:32:23.840
of short-term tax borrowings and it was on match terms mature and and June and we'll

872
1:32:23.840 --> 1:32:36.800
yield approximately 13,000 of net interest um the rates we have the 62.1 million that's been

873
1:32:36.800 --> 1:32:47.040
set for the year um prior years outstanding at this time of the 62,000 and we have currently

874
1:32:47.040 --> 1:32:58.720
464,000 outstanding at the year to date and then I'll take the rest of the report as

875
1:32:58.720 --> 1:33:09.520
being read and a few months got any questions. Okay any questions? Not a big change really to the

876
1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:15.920
what we have presented the count of meeting so um yeah we've heard about thanks for that NADA

877
1:33:16.640 --> 1:33:21.360
that's great and there being no questions or last for a move for the recommendation

878
1:33:22.320 --> 1:33:30.960
thank you Roger and a seconder. Thanks Claire thanks Claire catch you next time Philip

881
1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:58.720
Steve has still there so around yeah this is a absolutely um Steve Shaw's baby and um

882
1:33:58.720 --> 1:34:03.120
and a big beaver's beaver's well who has joined us so yeah we end up to Steve and Beaver.

883
1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:09.600
Great welcome Steve and Beaver. Hi guys. Nothing another good new story we need some of them.

884
1:34:12.400 --> 1:34:15.680
Steve wants to start off.

885
1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:35.120
Yeah yeah. Oh mine. Okay so I take a that you guys have read the report

886
1:34:35.600 --> 1:34:45.920
and the attachments to this I do see that there are a couple of questions from

887
1:34:45.920 --> 1:34:52.800
Claire but is there anything else that you guys would like to ask before I get to those questions from Claire

888
1:34:53.280 --> 1:35:01.920
and look slide the floor is yours Claire you had a couple of questions.

889
1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:08.880
Yeah well I mean the first one was that they were for the council entrance

890
1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:16.400
ways with the location of a number of accidents so if you looked into those entrance ways

891
1:35:16.400 --> 1:35:22.640
as they're something to do with that entrance ways like yeah beaver you want to try and

892
1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:29.680
like do you work or do you think what they were just the toe um traps and an entrance ways

893
1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:37.360
and we did get property to have a look and there wasn't anything of significance that we found

894
1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:50.320
can you guys hear me now? Yeah yeah so we didn't find anything of significance

895
1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:56.080
of why they trip the only thing we it was sort of at the lip with the doors

896
1:35:58.640 --> 1:36:04.560
kind of closed and this is at Cambridge so I did probably did have a look at those but we

897
1:36:04.560 --> 1:36:09.760
could find anything that would have caused those trips and we haven't had any

898
1:36:09.760 --> 1:36:14.880
reported sense so it may have been just one of those things but we are continuing to monitor

899
1:36:14.880 --> 1:36:21.360
anyway. Yeah yeah I mean we'll just be our luck that you know

900
1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:27.680
our facilities are causing a problem for people that are coming into this

901
1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:34.640
yeah yeah so I just thought bigger to now a bit more about that yeah okay can you hear me?

902
1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:41.280
Yes yes yes wonderful I'm so sorry I lost my voice there for a minute

903
1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:46.480
so I clear I understood you had another question as well and that was regarding

904
1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:52.560
what ways we have to keep track of how how to say do resources and processes have been utilized

905
1:36:52.880 --> 1:36:59.040
yeah that's a really good question perhaps if you go to the the A3 or the big

906
1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:06.960
report on a page above the Health and Safety due diligence plan monitoring above that as the

907
1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:13.760
Health and Safety lead indicators now these lead indicators are basically the resources

908
1:37:13.760 --> 1:37:21.760
and the contractors that we use and so essentially what we pay for and that's how we monitor

909
1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:26.960
and provide to you the details and what we're spending our Health and Safety budget on.

910
1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:32.800
We do have a very small Health and Safety budget obviously but that what does Health and Safety

911
1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:39.920
lead indicators show is that we we pay an ongoing fee to the White Cat Occupational Health

912
1:37:39.920 --> 1:37:47.600
Consultancy who deliver our Health Monitoring Services we also provide money to the EAP service

913
1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:56.000
which is so provides I guess counselling services to all of our staff we also have training

914
1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:02.160
Health and Safety Training so we have set aside 27,000 for Health and Safety Training in an

915
1:38:02.160 --> 1:38:10.000
annual year and that's that obviously is first day of refreshers and Health and Safety Committee

916
1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:16.640
Training as well as any investigation training which we're looking at at the moment and our

917
1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:22.240
regular conflict training which is obviously comes out of that budget as well and these are all

918
1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:28.240
reported through these reporting mechanisms to yourselves and also to the Executive Team

919
1:38:28.240 --> 1:38:35.440
so I guess that's one of our due diligence in how we show that we are utilizing external resources

920
1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:42.880
and finances appropriately. Honour that that's a great explanation and I can see how it all fits together.

921
1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:49.440
I guess I was wondering about how you knew if a distant individual staff members were actually

922
1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:56.720
you know knowledgeable about Health and Safety Practices or if they were starting new task

923
1:38:56.720 --> 1:39:00.400
or something that they they they they they they they they they get the right briefing and the

924
1:39:00.400 --> 1:39:09.360
stuff like that like you confident that that kind of sort of more grassroots those processes

925
1:39:10.320 --> 1:39:16.800
I think be a feel for a jump any but I'm actually very confident because we have some

926
1:39:17.920 --> 1:39:25.440
very good well educated Health and Safety representatives now and I must say they are

927
1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:31.840
committed they they attend the meetings they go back to their respective teams and they

928
1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:38.400
disseminate their information you know we're making sure that any training is out there

929
1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:46.480
I've got beef and tearing out working with all staff and specialty leaders and supervisors

930
1:39:46.480 --> 1:39:52.400
about how to keep their staff safe. I know that's great thank you.

931
1:39:53.040 --> 1:40:00.000
Yes, thank you can you hear me all right I can. No it doesn't seem to be coming through my head for

932
1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:08.080
I think this is a great report but the question I have is is the

933
1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:15.680
anywhere that we can assess some of the external influences on our teams health and safety

934
1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:25.600
from COVID-19. Yes absolutely and again they feel free to jump in here this report only

935
1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:32.720
covers the period from November through the February so critically it misses essentially misses

936
1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:41.120
all the COVID-19 that will come in the next report but yes absolutely we are we have a staff monitor

937
1:40:41.840 --> 1:40:46.000
or staff register which we monitor the health and well being of all our staff

938
1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:57.280
any that have immunocompanized health issues we are aware of where our staff are what they're doing

939
1:40:57.760 --> 1:41:04.800
and with us like we're moving to level three next week we've gone out to all managers

940
1:41:04.800 --> 1:41:10.480
to advise us of we're exactly this staff are going to be working whether they will be continuing

941
1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:17.120
to work from home whether we will have some like our parts operators working back out in the

942
1:41:17.120 --> 1:41:22.800
community and from the health and safety perspective we're working up some really good protocols

943
1:41:22.960 --> 1:41:30.960
around how to keep in the safe so I hope that answered your question council good. Yeah I was more

944
1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:37.200
wondering about whether any of the external influences of which we got not controlled you know

945
1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:41.760
that they're actually finding in their own family circumstances and something like that

946
1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:48.480
that's actually affecting their mental state which obviously is a health and certification.

947
1:41:48.880 --> 1:41:58.400
I can come in here if you like Steph I've just come out of a webinar with EMA in which

948
1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:03.920
one of New Zealand's leading people on Health and Safety Poor Javi was part of so that actually

949
1:42:03.920 --> 1:42:13.040
ruled up quite a few ways on how this can be managed in multiple levels and I know that our

950
1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:18.480
Viper team have been working along those same lines so you know this is all pretty new to

951
1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:26.000
everybody so we're still writing up those protocols and hopefully getting everything in place prior

952
1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:32.720
to actually going out next week on level three. Oh good big great to see those thanks.

953
1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:44.000
Right anybody else? No I just like to say it's it's great to see your Health and Safety

954
1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:53.760

955
1:42:53.760 --> 1:42:58.640
Gary's Health and Safety Commitment is a that's a really really good

956
1:42:58.640 --> 1:43:05.120
um you know I think to put in place um there's nothing like everybody in the

957
