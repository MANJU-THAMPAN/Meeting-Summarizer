0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.840
Once upon a time in a small village, their lived a boy named Rohan.

2
0:00:07.840 --> 0:00:11.200
Rohan was known for his laziness and lack of ambition.

3
0:00:11.200 --> 0:00:15.400
He had a habit of wasting time and procrastinating on important tasks.

4
0:00:15.400 --> 0:00:19.360
Despite the constant advice from his family and friends to value time, Rohan didn't seem

5
0:00:19.360 --> 0:00:21.640
to understand its importance.

6
0:00:21.640 --> 0:00:26.000
One sunny day, a wise old man named Mr. Gupta arrived in the village.

7
0:00:26.000 --> 0:00:29.760
He was known for his wisdom and ability to solve people's problems.

8
0:00:29.760 --> 0:00:34.120
He had a very quickly spread and soon Rohan heard about the arrival of Mr. Gupta.

9
0:00:34.120 --> 0:00:37.960
Curiosity peaked, he decided to seek the old man's guidance.

10
0:00:37.960 --> 0:00:43.200
Rohan approached Mr. Gupta who was sitting under a large bunion tree, with a respectful bow

11
0:00:43.200 --> 0:00:47.600
he asked, sir, I've been told that you possess great wisdom.

12
0:00:47.600 --> 0:00:50.480
Can you please guide me on how to make the most of my life?

13
0:00:50.480 --> 0:00:54.320
Mr. Gupta smiled and nodded, understanding the young man's struggle.

14
0:00:54.320 --> 0:00:57.800
He took out an hourglass from his bag and handed it to Rohan.

15
0:00:57.800 --> 0:01:00.840
His hourglass symbolizes time, he said.

16
0:01:00.840 --> 0:01:04.480
Each grain of sand represents a precious moment of your life.

17
0:01:04.480 --> 0:01:08.840
Rohan held the hourglass in his hands, feeling the weight of its significance.

18
0:01:08.840 --> 0:01:11.000
Now, Mr. Gupta continued.

19
0:01:11.000 --> 0:01:15.160
I want you to imagine that each grain of sand falling through this hourglass is a wasted

20
0:01:15.160 --> 0:01:16.560
opportunity.

21
0:01:16.560 --> 0:01:20.960
Every time you procrastinate or waste time, a grain slips away forever.

22
0:01:20.960 --> 0:01:26.680
Rohan, realizing the gravity of his actions, listened intently as Mr. Gupta continued.

23
0:01:26.680 --> 0:01:28.760
Time is a precious gift, my boy.

24
0:01:28.760 --> 0:01:30.400
It waits for no one.

25
0:01:30.400 --> 0:01:33.480
Every second that passes is a second you cannot retrieve.

26
0:01:33.480 --> 0:01:37.440
If you keep squandering it, you will wake up one day filled with regret.

27
0:01:37.440 --> 0:01:41.360
Feeling a sense of urgency, Rohan asked, but how can I change?

28
0:01:41.360 --> 0:01:44.080
How can I value time and make the most of it?

29
0:01:44.080 --> 0:01:46.040
Mr. Gupta smiled warmly.

30
0:01:46.040 --> 0:01:48.760
It begins with small steps, he said.

31
0:01:48.760 --> 0:01:51.560
Start by setting goals and prioritize your tasks.

32
0:01:51.560 --> 0:01:55.560
Break them down into manageable parts and focus on completing them one by one.

33
0:01:55.560 --> 0:01:57.560
Learn to manage your time effectively.

34
0:01:57.560 --> 0:02:01.720
Remember, success comes to those who understand the value of time.

35
0:02:01.720 --> 0:02:05.800
Rohan took the old man's advice to heart and decided to change his ways.

36
0:02:05.800 --> 0:02:11.080
He began by organizing his daily routine, setting specific timeframes for different activities.

37
0:02:11.080 --> 0:02:15.160
He eliminated distractions and focused solely on the task at hand.

38
0:02:15.160 --> 0:02:18.840
Gradually, Rohan noticed a positive shift in his life.

39
0:02:18.840 --> 0:02:22.240
Days turned into weeks and weeks into months.

40
0:02:22.240 --> 0:02:25.440
Rohan's newfound dedication and discipline paid off.

41
0:02:25.440 --> 0:02:28.600
He accomplished tasks that he had been putting off for years.

42
0:02:28.600 --> 0:02:31.840
He pursued his passions and discovered hidden talents.

43
0:02:31.840 --> 0:02:36.160
The villagers marveled at the remarkable transformation they witnessed in Rohan.

44
0:02:36.160 --> 0:02:41.280
Over time, Rohan realized that the true power of time lay not just in accomplishing tasks,

45
0:02:41.280 --> 0:02:43.360
but in nurturing relationships.

46
0:02:43.360 --> 0:02:48.360
He spent quality time with his family and friends appreciating the moments they shared.

47
0:02:48.360 --> 0:02:52.840
He understood that time was a limited resource and every second spent in the company of loved ones

48
0:02:52.840 --> 0:02:54.320
was a treasure.

49
0:02:54.320 --> 0:02:56.920
His characters passed and Rohan grew old.

50
0:02:56.920 --> 0:03:01.280
His village honored him for his remarkable achievements and his wise use of time.

51
0:03:01.280 --> 0:03:05.840
He shared his journey with the younger generation, urging them to cherish every passing moment

52
0:03:05.840 --> 0:03:08.120
and make the most of their lives.

53
0:03:08.120 --> 0:03:12.880
Rohan's story spread far and wide, inspiring countless individuals to re-evaluate their

54
0:03:12.880 --> 0:03:15.080
relationship with time.

55
0:03:15.080 --> 0:03:19.360
People began to understand that time was not just a mere commodity, but a precious gift

56
0:03:19.360 --> 0:03:21.240
that needed to be treasured.

57
0:03:21.240 --> 0:03:27.040
And so, the village thrived under the wisdom of Mr. Gupta and the transformed life of Rohan.

58
0:03:27.040 --> 0:03:31.240
Reminding every one of the importance of time and the power it held to shape their destinies.
