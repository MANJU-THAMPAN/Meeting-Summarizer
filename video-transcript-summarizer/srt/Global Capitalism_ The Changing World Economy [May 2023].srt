0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:08.800
Welcome friends to another global capitalism live economic update,

2
0:00:08.800 --> 0:00:16.200
a presentation we make every other month that is sponsored by Democracy at Work

3
0:00:16.200 --> 0:00:25.400
and by the Left Forum. Before jumping into our topic for today, which is a rapidly

4
0:00:25.400 --> 0:00:32.400
changing world economy that we're going to look at in detail. I wanted to explain

5
0:00:32.400 --> 0:00:40.400
and to apologize for a delay. Normally this presentation would have been premiered

6
0:00:40.400 --> 0:00:48.600
on the second Wednesday of the month which would have been May 10th. But two phenomena

7
0:00:48.600 --> 0:00:54.800
intervened that made us postpone until now what would have otherwise happened

8
0:00:54.800 --> 0:01:03.200
earlier this month. Number one and the more important I got COVID. I've never had

9
0:01:03.200 --> 0:01:12.400
COVID before and it really knocked me down for a good 10 days including the 10th of May.

10
0:01:12.400 --> 0:01:19.800
So that had to be postponed because I was literally a too little to make the presentation

11
0:01:19.800 --> 0:01:26.600
plus I had to be sequestered and not in contact with other folks. And the second reason

12
0:01:26.600 --> 0:01:34.400
is a reorganization inside Democracy at Work, the organization that presents these talks

13
0:01:34.400 --> 0:01:41.400
every other month. And so the combination of the COVID illness and the reorganization, both

14
0:01:41.400 --> 0:01:48.800
of which will be behind us by the time we meet again on the second Wednesday of July. So

15
0:01:48.800 --> 0:01:58.000
I do ask your understanding for the exceptional circumstances that made this presentation

16
0:01:58.000 --> 0:02:06.160
three weeks late. Okay, I want to turn then to our topic which is a fast changing world

17
0:02:06.160 --> 0:02:14.920
economy. And let me stress what I am describing is not something distant. The world economy

18
0:02:15.000 --> 0:02:23.880
is no longer something far away if it ever was. It is now an ongoing reality that shapes

19
0:02:23.880 --> 0:02:32.920
everyone's daily life from China to Canada, from Mexico to Paraguay, everywhere in the world

20
0:02:32.920 --> 0:02:40.600
is affected by the world economy because we are now an integrated, economically speaking,

21
0:02:40.760 --> 0:02:51.160
integrated planet. And we have to learn to deal with the world economy because of its immediate

22
0:02:51.160 --> 0:03:00.200
impact on us. It's in that spirit that I want to talk with you today about the big rapid changes

23
0:03:00.200 --> 0:03:10.440
going on in the world economy. First of all, there really are now two major economic blocks

24
0:03:10.520 --> 0:03:20.600
or units that confront each other in a clear dichotomy that was never as clear as it is today.

25
0:03:21.720 --> 0:03:34.040
On the one hand, you might say the old dominant block of the world economy currently called the G7.

26
0:03:35.000 --> 0:03:43.480
Basically that's the United States. It's Western European allies, Canada and Japan.

27
0:03:45.560 --> 0:03:56.120
That's a block. It is very rich. It is very powerful. It has been the dominant economic

28
0:03:56.200 --> 0:04:03.160
reality with a specially dominant role for the United States for many decades.

29
0:04:04.520 --> 0:04:12.200
But there is now another block. And we all have to get used to what that means. The other block

30
0:04:13.080 --> 0:04:24.200
for lack of a similar designation, I'm going to call the BRICS nations. BRICS. And I want to make

31
0:04:24.280 --> 0:04:31.160
clear not only who's in the BRICS, but why and how it is the other block.

32
0:04:32.280 --> 0:04:41.560
First of all, what do the letters stand for? Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa,

33
0:04:41.560 --> 0:04:48.920
the BRICS nations. And from everything I can gather, there's at least another dozen countries,

34
0:04:48.920 --> 0:04:57.800
including very large ones, that are applying to join the BRICS. But even before we look at

35
0:04:57.800 --> 0:05:04.840
who else might be joining, there's something remarkable about the BRICS that has to be spoken to right now.

36
0:05:06.040 --> 0:05:11.640
India and China are the two largest countries on this planet by population.

37
0:05:12.600 --> 0:05:22.200
Russia is the largest country on this planet by geography. Any association of countries that have

38
0:05:22.200 --> 0:05:29.320
the two most populous and the one with the largest geography would have to be taken seriously.

39
0:05:30.680 --> 0:05:37.640
The BRICS have been there as a group for some years, most of which they were not taken seriously.

40
0:05:38.360 --> 0:05:45.480
But now, over the last year and a half, they've become much more serious in the eyes of

41
0:05:45.480 --> 0:05:51.720
everyone in the world with the exception of those. And we'll come to that at the end of today's talk,

42
0:05:51.720 --> 0:06:00.680
who have a vested interest in pretending not to see what's going on. Let me dramatize the importance

43
0:06:01.640 --> 0:06:12.280
of the BRICS beyond what I have said. The year 2020 was a crucial marker of something.

44
0:06:13.640 --> 0:06:23.720
In that year, the total GDP gross domestic product of all the G7 nations, the United States and its allies

45
0:06:24.680 --> 0:06:33.000
was about the same as the total output of goods and services, the total GDP of the BRICS.

46
0:06:34.280 --> 0:06:42.440
They were about the same. The BRICS had been rising as a percentage of the world's output

47
0:06:43.000 --> 0:06:50.280
and the G7 had been declining and in the year 2020 the two lines crossed.

48
0:06:51.240 --> 0:06:59.240
Which means that when I tell you what the situation is now, midway through 2023,

49
0:07:01.480 --> 0:07:10.280
the G7 has continued to decline. That is the proportion of the global output of goods and services

50
0:07:10.280 --> 0:07:18.440
accounted for by the G7 nations, United States and its allies, is now below 30%.

51
0:07:20.280 --> 0:07:30.360
Whereas the total GDP of the BRICS nations is today approximately 33%. In other words,

52
0:07:31.160 --> 0:07:39.320
the G7 is no longer the dominant producer of goods and services in the world economy.

53
0:07:40.360 --> 0:07:48.360
It has fallen to second place and falling is what it has been doing for quite a while and gives

54
0:07:48.440 --> 0:07:59.160
every sign of continuing to do so. I am I dramatized that fact by comparing the GDP growth

55
0:07:59.960 --> 0:08:09.240
in the United States in the first quarter of 2023 with a GDP growth in the first quarter of 2023 in

56
0:08:09.240 --> 0:08:21.160
China. In the United States, that rate of growth annualized 1%. In China, 4.5%. You see the direction

57
0:08:21.160 --> 0:08:30.280
of change and this is important because it means that for every country in the world and for most

58
0:08:30.280 --> 0:08:36.840
of the businesses in every country that either are involved in the export of goods and services

59
0:08:36.920 --> 0:08:45.400
or in the import of goods and services, the world economy is changing in the sense that the BRICS

60
0:08:45.400 --> 0:08:55.240
countries are becoming more and more important as sources of capital, as trading partners, relative

61
0:08:55.240 --> 0:09:04.520
to the G7 who are becoming less and less important. And much of today's talk will be elaborating

62
0:09:04.600 --> 0:09:12.760
the implications of this split and changing world economy.

63
0:09:15.400 --> 0:09:23.880
I want to turn next to the military aspects of all of this and I think they are important.

64
0:09:24.600 --> 0:09:38.040
In a way, the long term decline of the economic importance of the G7 nations has had a kind of

65
0:09:38.040 --> 0:09:49.080
parallel, militarily speaking, coming to a crescendo over the last 18 months. But I think the history

66
0:09:49.080 --> 0:10:03.080
of military conflicts after World War II tells us something. Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq.

67
0:10:04.840 --> 0:10:15.640
Each of those involved a defeat for the United States militarily. It did not achieve

68
0:10:16.520 --> 0:10:22.920
many of the objectives each of those wars that the United States set out at the beginning.

69
0:10:25.240 --> 0:10:35.000
It should have been clear that the danger of using nuclear weapons meant that these would be wars

70
0:10:35.000 --> 0:10:47.560
fought in Asia, land wars, and that the United States would be at a disadvantage even with

71
0:10:47.560 --> 0:10:56.840
the enormous preponderance of economic and political wealth and power that it wielded coming out

72
0:10:56.920 --> 0:11:05.240
of World War II. But one might have overlooked those signs in the wind.

73
0:11:06.440 --> 0:11:10.680
Were it not for what has happened over the last 18 months?

74
0:11:13.800 --> 0:11:25.080
Russia invaded Ukraine and a war commenced in February of 2022 still ongoing that pits Russia

75
0:11:25.240 --> 0:11:39.160
on one side. Ukraine partly on the other side. I say partly because Ukraine is now a totally

76
0:11:39.160 --> 0:11:47.560
dependent economically, politically and militarily on the United States and to some degree, the

77
0:11:47.560 --> 0:11:56.120
NATO partners of the United States. And again, because nuclear weapons are insane and off the

78
0:11:56.120 --> 0:12:07.000
table, at least one hopes. We are left with a land war Russians against Ukrainians supplied by

79
0:12:07.080 --> 0:12:16.760
US and NATO. And so the US and NATO made a decision, a strategic decision to militarily

80
0:12:16.760 --> 0:12:26.600
equip the Ukrainians, but to rely more on an economic war against Russia. And they're in

81
0:12:26.680 --> 0:12:36.440
lay a strategic mistake, which it is clear to most of the world is playing out now. Here's the

82
0:12:36.440 --> 0:12:50.520
mistake. Russia is part of bricks. The bricks is a real alliance of countries who have a determination

83
0:12:50.520 --> 0:13:00.280
that there needs to be a change in the world economy. One that is symbolized and measured by the

84
0:13:00.280 --> 0:13:11.160
decline of G7 relative to the extent of the bricks. Long story short, Russia could shift the

85
0:13:11.240 --> 0:13:22.200
export of oil and gas from Europe. The now enemy over to China and India partners in bricks.

86
0:13:22.200 --> 0:13:31.640
And thereby evade most of what the sanctions applied against Russia were designed to accomplish.

87
0:13:31.880 --> 0:13:43.960
In addition, Russia could turn for all kinds of direct and indirect supports means of evading

88
0:13:43.960 --> 0:13:53.560
sanctions, means of going around sanctions, blunting the political effects of the invasion of Ukraine.

89
0:13:53.560 --> 0:14:02.280
All of this was done in good part because of the power of bricks, because of the number of

90
0:14:02.280 --> 0:14:10.200
countries that seek to join bricks and therefore do not want to alienate one of the key players in

91
0:14:10.200 --> 0:14:18.360
bricks, namely Russia. The whole landscape of economic conflict has changed.

92
0:14:19.320 --> 0:14:26.840
Giving Russia a level of support that made the statements by President Biden and many others

93
0:14:27.960 --> 0:14:34.120
that the economic war against Russia would collapse the rubble, would bring that country to its knees.

94
0:14:34.920 --> 0:14:44.200
None of that has happened. And the repeated escalation of the weapons deliveries to the Ukrainians,

95
0:14:44.360 --> 0:14:53.320
which have not achieved a military victory, have also not done much to change the basic

96
0:14:53.320 --> 0:15:01.800
economic stalemate because that's what it is since the objective of crushing the Russian economy

97
0:15:02.520 --> 0:15:11.480
is nowhere in sight. That's a sign and a measure of the changing world economy.

98
0:15:12.360 --> 0:15:19.640
And here comes another one. As you'll see, I'm able to present to you quite a list.

99
0:15:20.760 --> 0:15:29.640
The next one is called dollar or de-dollarization of the world economy. What do I mean?

100
0:15:30.760 --> 0:15:38.200
After World War II, the global economy was so dominated by the United States that the United

101
0:15:38.200 --> 0:15:48.680
States currency, the US dollar, became the global currency. So for example, central banks around

102
0:15:48.680 --> 0:15:56.360
the world seeking to hold reserves that would give confidence to anybody doing business in the

103
0:15:56.360 --> 0:16:05.640
currency of that country. They would hold and reserve gold, the global value behind money

104
0:16:06.520 --> 0:16:16.440
at the time. And the dollar, which was deemed literally to be as good as gold, as valuable as

105
0:16:16.440 --> 0:16:23.400
gold. So central banks held reserves in gold and held reserves in US dollars.

106
0:16:25.720 --> 0:16:33.000
Something like 80, 90 percent of global central banks reserves were in dollars.

107
0:16:33.400 --> 0:16:45.400
Today, that number is less than half. Under 45 percent of the world's central banks reserves are in US dollars.

108
0:16:46.600 --> 0:16:56.440
Gold, euros, Japanese yen, Chinese you want. They are replacing and then are alone.

109
0:16:57.320 --> 0:17:04.600
They are replacing the US dollar. And the pace of that replacement has accelerated,

110
0:17:04.600 --> 0:17:09.960
most of it happening in this century, that is since the year 2000.

111
0:17:12.440 --> 0:17:21.240
But this is not all. The dollar is less than less used these days compared with 20 years ago,

112
0:17:21.400 --> 0:17:28.920
or 40 years ago, or 60 years ago. The dollar is much less used in international trade.

113
0:17:29.880 --> 0:17:36.200
Goods and services and investments moving from one country to another, often in the past,

114
0:17:36.200 --> 0:17:43.880
were handled with dollars. The world had to hold on to dollars. Businesses had to hold on to

115
0:17:43.880 --> 0:17:49.880
dollars all over the world because their regular business was conducted in dollars.

116
0:17:51.720 --> 0:17:59.240
Soria Arabia took the initiative with the support of the United States in creating the so-called

117
0:17:59.240 --> 0:18:08.360
Petro dollar. An arrangement in which much of the world's trade of oil, a central source of energy,

118
0:18:08.760 --> 0:18:16.920
was conducted in dollars, paid by country A, that needed to import oil to country B, that needed to

119
0:18:16.920 --> 0:18:26.280
export it. And that, of course, meant that you had to keep dollars to buy and handle the energy

120
0:18:26.280 --> 0:18:35.480
requirements of your economy. More and more, literally every week now, announcements are made

121
0:18:35.480 --> 0:18:44.600
where countries, including Soria Arabia, are changing over and trading oil for other currencies.

122
0:18:45.320 --> 0:18:54.200
China's currency, Europe's currencies, even the currencies of Asia, Africa and Latin American

123
0:18:54.200 --> 0:19:00.920
countries. And this has enormous consequences. The simplest one to understand is this.

124
0:19:02.360 --> 0:19:09.640
The United States has been subsidized by the world's use of its currency. One way to see it

125
0:19:09.720 --> 0:19:16.360
is to understand that when foreign countries send goods and services to the United States,

126
0:19:17.320 --> 0:19:26.280
wine from France, software programs from Japan, minerals and so forth from Asia and Africa and

127
0:19:26.280 --> 0:19:35.000
Latin America. And they pay for them with dollars, they're paying with a very cheap piece of green paper.

128
0:19:35.880 --> 0:19:43.480
Cost literally nothing. We get the fruits of labor. We get the creativity of the productive

129
0:19:43.480 --> 0:19:51.960
apparatus of the world for Americans to consume, for American businesses, to use as inputs to their

130
0:19:51.960 --> 0:20:01.800
own production. And all we as a nation have to give in exchange is totally costless pieces of green

131
0:20:01.880 --> 0:20:11.000
paper, the dollar. And then we get a double subsidy. Because of course, as all the dollars go out

132
0:20:11.000 --> 0:20:18.280
to pay for all the goods we import. And those dollars accumulate in the banks, the private banks,

133
0:20:18.280 --> 0:20:26.200
the central banks of other countries, they don't want to hold on to a dollar that pays them

134
0:20:26.200 --> 0:20:32.200
no interest. They need to hold on to access the dollars. They need to be able to get those dollars

135
0:20:32.200 --> 0:20:38.520
because they need them to buy oil and to do the world's business. But they're not earning anything

136
0:20:38.520 --> 0:20:46.360
while they hold the dollars. So know what they do. They turn around and take those dollars and lend them

137
0:20:47.080 --> 0:20:55.800
to the United States government. They buy treasury bills. And thereby they fund the budget

138
0:20:55.880 --> 0:21:04.760
deficits of the United States. They enable the United States government to tax corporations and the

139
0:21:04.760 --> 0:21:14.040
rich, much less than they otherwise would have to. It's a subsidy to corporations and the rich.

140
0:21:15.640 --> 0:21:24.440
As running the deficits always has been. That is the reality of the double benefit that the

141
0:21:24.440 --> 0:21:32.680
dollar as world currency once conveyed on the United States. But the United States is now

142
0:21:32.680 --> 0:21:39.960
losing that subsidy. Losing the ability to borrow the way it once did.

143
0:21:40.840 --> 0:21:48.440
Discovering that it's going to be harder to finance the deficits of the future US government

144
0:21:49.080 --> 0:21:56.600
than it was in the past because the dollars are not out there waiting anxiously to be lent

145
0:21:56.600 --> 0:22:05.880
to the US government as their way of holding the dollar. What will we see in the place of the

146
0:22:05.880 --> 0:22:14.760
dollar? Well basically there's one of two things. Either the Chinese, Yuan because China is the great

147
0:22:14.840 --> 0:22:23.560
other of the United States, the US and its allies that's G7, China and its allies that's the bricks.

148
0:22:25.320 --> 0:22:33.000
But we're going to see a new currency replace the dollar either the Chinese currency or if they can

149
0:22:33.000 --> 0:22:43.720
do it a composite. A new international currency that will be backed by a bunch of countries not just by one.

150
0:22:44.840 --> 0:22:50.520
You know we were used to the British pound during the British Empire being the global currency

151
0:22:51.160 --> 0:22:57.080
and the US dollar being the global currency during the heyday of the American empire.

152
0:22:58.280 --> 0:23:03.960
It will be an interesting question whether the emerging China slash bricks

153
0:23:05.560 --> 0:23:12.120
global dominance economically will make one or a basket of currencies function

154
0:23:12.760 --> 0:23:23.160
as the global exchange medium in the future. Another dimension of the fast-changing world economy

155
0:23:23.720 --> 0:23:31.560
that I want to bring to your attention is the role of China in two basic ways.

156
0:23:33.640 --> 0:23:40.840
China is the emerging economic powerhouse, everyone in the world who pays attention knows that.

157
0:23:42.120 --> 0:23:51.320
And one of the interesting ways in which China is playing this emerging powerful role

158
0:23:52.360 --> 0:24:03.000
is by becoming a global peacemaker. By far the most dramatic evidence of that was the role of the

159
0:24:03.000 --> 0:24:13.880
Chinese in bringing together the bitter enemies Iran and Saudi Arabia who have been bitter enemies

160
0:24:13.880 --> 0:24:19.560
for a long time and efforts to overcome their enmity.

161
0:24:21.720 --> 0:24:27.000
So far as the United States made such efforts were clearly unsuccessful.

162
0:24:27.720 --> 0:24:35.480
The Chinese did it. They have now exchanged ambassadors and the secondary and tertiary

163
0:24:36.120 --> 0:24:44.520
consequences of peace between those two countries are playing themselves out in the headlines every day.

164
0:24:46.600 --> 0:24:52.200
Why is this important? Well the symbolism could not be stronger.

165
0:24:53.160 --> 0:25:02.120
The United States which like to position itself as global head-juman global peacemaker if possible

166
0:25:02.120 --> 0:25:10.120
has now been challenged by another country playing that role in the same tumultuous Middle East

167
0:25:10.120 --> 0:25:17.560
where the United States fancied itself in that role. It now has to share the spotlight

168
0:25:17.640 --> 0:25:25.720
if it doesn't lose the spotlight altogether. But beyond the symbolism of peacemaker,

169
0:25:26.440 --> 0:25:33.480
there's something else going on here. The fact is that over the last 30 to 40 years

170
0:25:34.520 --> 0:25:47.000
we've had relatively speaking peace. Yes we've had wars. The war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan and so on.

171
0:25:47.080 --> 0:25:56.840
But these wars were well localized, mostly in Asia not only but mostly, but localized. In the general

172
0:25:56.840 --> 0:26:06.520
global perspective, these were decades of peace and the Chinese are a cutely aware

173
0:26:07.480 --> 0:26:17.240
that their rise from a poor third world country with the added burden of being the most

174
0:26:17.240 --> 0:26:26.840
populist country in the world that their incredibly rapid ascendancy to being the great competitive

175
0:26:26.920 --> 0:26:36.200
challenger of the United States took place over 40 years of relative globally speaking peace.

176
0:26:38.520 --> 0:26:48.520
They want the peace because it has worked very well for them. They did not have to disturb

177
0:26:48.520 --> 0:26:56.360
their own economy by going on to a wartime footing. They did not have to debit their own

178
0:26:56.360 --> 0:27:04.600
economy to move militarily around the world. They don't have foreign bases. They didn't create any.

179
0:27:04.600 --> 0:27:12.520
They didn't have foreign adventures. They didn't create any. They could and did devote themselves

180
0:27:12.520 --> 0:27:19.880
to economic development with a kind of focus that has something to do with the extraordinary

181
0:27:19.880 --> 0:27:32.360
performance they have shown us. They have become ironically advocates of an open-world economy

182
0:27:33.320 --> 0:27:41.000
of globalizing continuously. Here's the irony some of you should enjoy.

183
0:27:41.080 --> 0:27:51.960
On the one hand, the term neoliberalism and the term globalization went hand in hand over the

184
0:27:51.960 --> 0:28:02.360
last 30 to 40 years. They were the ideological way of saying how happy Western capitalists were

185
0:28:02.440 --> 0:28:13.640
in the United States in Europe in Japan with the arrival for them of a vast new cheap labor force.

186
0:28:13.640 --> 0:28:23.960
It's a capitalist dream. China was bringing its enormous population and presenting them

187
0:28:23.960 --> 0:28:32.040
to global mega corporations capitalists. Here come to China and in the lesser extent come to

188
0:28:32.040 --> 0:28:40.280
India, come to Brazil and you will have very hard working people who are willing to accept

189
0:28:40.280 --> 0:28:49.240
much lower wages and that will be a profit bonanza for you and it was the last 30 to 40 years

190
0:28:49.240 --> 0:29:01.000
our stock market booms in the Western capitalist area. But while that boom for the West was the driving

191
0:29:01.080 --> 0:29:14.120
force, China was making its own way forward using the neoliberal globalist arguments of an open

192
0:29:14.120 --> 0:29:20.920
economy of having capitalists come to China to produce their what they would ship back to their own

193
0:29:20.920 --> 0:29:28.200
countries. China became the producer for the world. China's manufacturing exploded.

194
0:29:29.160 --> 0:29:37.640
China did better with neoliberalism and globalization than the West who invented those words

195
0:29:37.640 --> 0:29:46.120
and who invented the thrust into that part of the world for reasons of profit maximization.

196
0:29:46.200 --> 0:29:58.600
Marx and Hagle would smile and remind us of the contradictions that beset whatever happens

197
0:29:58.600 --> 0:30:08.840
in the world. Yes neoliberalism and globalization were phases of capitalism growing of capitalism

198
0:30:08.920 --> 0:30:17.640
having its exploitative relation with labor become global. But the ironic contradiction was it

199
0:30:17.640 --> 0:30:28.760
made it possible for China to gain even more out of this capitalist initiative than the capitalist

200
0:30:28.760 --> 0:30:37.880
themselves. So we get the ironies flower. In today's world as the United States and Europe,

201
0:30:38.760 --> 0:30:47.000
begin to comprehend that China made more out of neoliberalism and globalization than they did.

202
0:30:47.960 --> 0:30:56.360
They are abandoning neoliberalism and globalization. Aren't they? They're becoming nationalistic.

203
0:30:57.320 --> 0:31:08.600
Not just Mr Trump with his tariff war against China. Not just the trade wars against China,

204
0:31:09.320 --> 0:31:16.920
but even though Trump is gone for the moment and Biden replaced him, Biden continues and

205
0:31:16.920 --> 0:31:26.760
if anything intensifies a turn away from neoliberalism, a turn away from globalization and the

206
0:31:26.760 --> 0:31:34.680
embrace of a new kind of economic nationalism in which the United States government now followed

207
0:31:34.680 --> 0:31:41.960
by European governments and so on are turning inward. Ego to subsidize their own

208
0:31:42.680 --> 0:31:51.640
industries and enterprises. Less a fair is a vague memory active government intervention is the

209
0:31:51.640 --> 0:32:02.840
name of today's economic politics. That's a reaction to the world economies changing that will

210
0:32:02.840 --> 0:32:11.560
have many, many repercussions in the years to come. Not the least of which will be the

211
0:32:11.560 --> 0:32:20.680
painful discovery by capitalists in Europe and North America that if they really intend to follow through,

212
0:32:22.040 --> 0:32:29.160
one of two things has to happen. Either they will have to pay the wages that are still

213
0:32:29.160 --> 0:32:37.400
relatively high in Western Europe and the United States and therefore be unable to compete very well

214
0:32:37.480 --> 0:32:46.200
with those enterprises that have the advantage of lower cost labor or they will drive down the

215
0:32:46.200 --> 0:32:55.080
wages in Western Europe and North America. But that risks producing a militant labor movement

216
0:32:55.080 --> 0:33:03.560
that can challenge capitalism from within which way that's going to work out either way poses

217
0:33:03.880 --> 0:33:11.960
enormous problems which the current rush away from the olibrolysm and globalization and into

218
0:33:11.960 --> 0:33:19.960
economic nationalism is making people misunderstand. But we're going to have to live through

219
0:33:20.680 --> 0:33:28.200
the new moan that comes, the awakening that what we didn't pay attention to is going to shape

220
0:33:28.280 --> 0:33:38.120
our daily life all around the world. The next aspect of the changing world economy

221
0:33:39.800 --> 0:33:46.760
focuses even more on China. I had mentioned that China in two ways is shaking the world economy.

222
0:33:47.320 --> 0:33:53.080
I've mentioned the one now I want to deal with the other one and the other one has to do with how the

223
0:33:53.080 --> 0:34:05.160
world economy is making sense of what happened in China that enabled them the Chinese to make such

224
0:34:05.160 --> 0:34:14.840
advances during the period of neoliberal globalization. Why did this capitalist strategy? This capitalist

225
0:34:14.920 --> 0:34:23.560
initiative, this capitalist mechanism for profit maximization. Why and how were the Chinese able

226
0:34:23.560 --> 0:34:32.920
to take advantage of that in the way that they did? And the answer is I think to be found

227
0:34:33.960 --> 0:34:41.640
in both the unique successes and the unique failure of the people's Republic of China.

228
0:34:42.600 --> 0:34:53.240
First the success. China broke from the Soviet Union which in many ways was a kind of model for it.

229
0:34:54.520 --> 0:35:03.640
And China also broke away from the United States which in a different manner was also a model for it.

230
0:35:04.600 --> 0:35:12.920
And in the two breaks I think you can find the key to China's growth success.

231
0:35:14.600 --> 0:35:22.280
First of all the break from Russia from Soviet Russia. In the Soviet Union the government moved in

232
0:35:22.920 --> 0:35:30.680
and took over the ownership and operation of Russian industry.

233
0:35:33.960 --> 0:35:43.800
The five-year plans, the council of ministers, the government became the owner operator of

234
0:35:43.800 --> 0:35:51.320
industrial production. Agriculture much less so and only later. But industrial

235
0:35:52.440 --> 0:36:00.920
governmental ownership and operation was a core commitment starting already in the 1920s and

236
0:36:00.920 --> 0:36:12.440
really getting going in the 1930s and since. China did not do that. China did not. China

237
0:36:13.000 --> 0:36:24.520
allocated, accepted, encouraged and financed private capitalism alongside stayed owned and operated

238
0:36:24.520 --> 0:36:34.920
industrial enterprises. That's a break from the model of the Soviet Union. At the same time and

239
0:36:34.920 --> 0:36:41.720
in the same way the Chinese broke from the growth on capitalist model if you like

240
0:36:41.720 --> 0:36:52.920
of the United Kingdom the United States. And in a parallel way it did not focus on prioritized

241
0:36:53.640 --> 0:37:01.960
private industrial enterprises. Enterprises in industry that were owned and operated by

242
0:37:01.960 --> 0:37:13.160
private individuals, individual persons, individual families or individual shareholders via the stock market.

243
0:37:14.040 --> 0:37:23.800
China didn't have an overwhelmingly state owned and operated industry nor an overwhelmingly

244
0:37:23.800 --> 0:37:36.360
private industry. Now what China did was unique and original. It really developed its own hybrid

245
0:37:37.080 --> 0:37:48.280
mixture of private and public enterprises in industry and both of them subordinated to

246
0:37:49.320 --> 0:37:55.160
an effective control from the Chinese Communist Party.

247
0:37:57.960 --> 0:38:05.240
When the Chinese refer to their own system as quote unquote socialism with Chinese

248
0:38:05.320 --> 0:38:17.000
characteristics, it is that hybrid and that supervisory control of a political party, a powerful political

249
0:38:17.000 --> 0:38:26.920
party. That is the unique original strategic form that Chinese economics took.

250
0:38:27.640 --> 0:38:37.240
And it is crucial to how they were able to utilize the neoliberal globalist period of capitalism

251
0:38:38.840 --> 0:38:47.320
to outgrow the very capitalism that put us in a neoliberal globalist phase.

252
0:38:47.400 --> 0:38:55.640
But I said it was also a failure in what sense was a failure.

253
0:38:56.680 --> 0:39:10.040
Well I think the way to understand that is to draw a comparison between Lenin, a key leader of the Soviet

254
0:39:10.040 --> 0:39:17.960
Union, Xi Jinping, the current leader of the people's Republic of China.

255
0:39:19.320 --> 0:39:27.320
You might think of Lenin as having faced the following situation.

256
0:39:28.600 --> 0:39:34.280
Early in the history of the Soviet Union, after all I'm sure you all know that Lenin died of

257
0:39:34.280 --> 0:39:40.600
very few years after the Russian Revolution. So anything he said would have had to be said in the

258
0:39:40.600 --> 0:39:47.800
early period of the Soviet Union. He referred to what they had achieved by their revolution as an

259
0:39:47.880 --> 0:39:58.440
I quote, state capitalism. And he said that the challenge faced in Russia at that time in Soviet

260
0:39:58.440 --> 0:40:10.280
Russia was the capacity or not of the Soviet Communist Party. The challenge it faced was

261
0:40:10.360 --> 0:40:18.280
making the transition from the state capitalism that they had constructed out of the revolution

262
0:40:19.480 --> 0:40:28.920
into a genuine and socialist post-capitalist economy. In other words, could the party

263
0:40:28.920 --> 0:40:36.360
would the party enable the Soviet Union to get beyond state capitalism?

264
0:40:36.760 --> 0:40:49.720
In point of fact, the party and the Soviet society were never able to go that next step.

265
0:40:50.920 --> 0:40:58.920
There are many reasons. My colleague Stephen Resdening and I wrote a book a few years ago trying to explain

266
0:40:59.880 --> 0:41:12.360
why they couldn't make that step. But here I want to confront you and our Chinese brothers and

267
0:41:12.360 --> 0:41:21.800
sisters with a parallel challenge facing Xi Jinping and the Chinese society now.

268
0:41:22.520 --> 0:41:37.720
They have erected a hybrid, a unique original society split between a private capitalism and a

269
0:41:37.720 --> 0:41:45.480
state capitalism. And let me be clear about why I call them capitalism. Why I call all of these

270
0:41:45.480 --> 0:41:50.680
capitalism, whether they're in the United States or in China, whether they're state or private,

271
0:41:51.560 --> 0:41:58.360
because they have one thing all in common. It's that one thing that Karl Marx focuses on

272
0:41:59.160 --> 0:42:08.280
in the capital volume one, the center piece of his adult mature creativity. What makes capitalism

273
0:42:08.360 --> 0:42:15.640
capitalist is that unique relationship between a small group of people who make the decisions,

274
0:42:15.640 --> 0:42:22.280
the employer, the employer class, the capitalist class, the entrepreneur, whatever you want to call them

275
0:42:22.280 --> 0:42:30.120
on the one hand, a minority, a small minority. And on the other, a vast majority, the proletariat,

276
0:42:30.120 --> 0:42:37.960
the working class, the employee class, whatever you want to call them. Enterprises governed by that

277
0:42:38.040 --> 0:42:48.520
dichotomy, a small powerful wealth accumulating governing group and a mass employee

278
0:42:49.480 --> 0:42:56.280
group producing the profits that that minority gathers and disposes of.

279
0:42:57.640 --> 0:43:05.560
Going beyond that, having an economic system in which the enterprise is a community of equals,

280
0:43:06.520 --> 0:43:15.320
one person, one vote, a cooperative enterprise, a workers cooperative, a workers self-directed

281
0:43:15.320 --> 0:43:21.480
enterprise. That was the challenge, Lenin face. And that is the challenge,

282
0:43:22.440 --> 0:43:30.440
Xi Jinping and the others in China also face. And they haven't made the transition.

283
0:43:31.160 --> 0:43:39.640
They never did in the Soviet Union and the question for China is, can you make that

284
0:43:39.640 --> 0:43:48.360
term, will you make that transition? They haven't done so yet. And that may be more than

285
0:43:48.360 --> 0:43:57.080
is reasonable to have expected given that there are society that begins to move in these directions

286
0:43:57.080 --> 0:44:06.200
only after the Civil War is won in 1949. But the question imposes itself by the very history.

287
0:44:07.560 --> 0:44:15.880
And if let's put a different, however this question is answered in and by China,

288
0:44:16.680 --> 0:44:24.280
will shape the whole world economy, whether they accept the challenge and move and make that transition,

289
0:44:24.360 --> 0:44:30.920
or they don't. Either way, the Chinese given their position in the world today

290
0:44:33.080 --> 0:44:43.800
are going to shake everything and everyone. Okay, by way of conclusion, I want to talk

291
0:44:44.520 --> 0:44:53.800
about the rapidly changing world economy in terms of how it is being processed

292
0:44:53.880 --> 0:45:02.920
understood, particularly here in the United States, which I'm in the best position to try to

293
0:45:02.920 --> 0:45:10.680
understand because I live and work here in the United States. And I've had some help recently,

294
0:45:10.680 --> 0:45:20.920
which is so interesting that I want to bring it to your attention. A very well-respected non-partisan

295
0:45:21.720 --> 0:45:33.880
polling institution is called PEW Pew Research Center. And they did a poll here in the United

296
0:45:33.880 --> 0:45:42.360
States of a large number of randomly selected American citizens. The poll was conducted between

297
0:45:42.360 --> 0:45:54.360
March 27th and April 2nd of the year 2023. So it's just a few weeks old. And the Americans

298
0:45:54.440 --> 0:46:08.680
pulled were asked the following question. Please compare this year 2023 with what you believe will

299
0:46:08.680 --> 0:46:20.920
be this situation in 2050 that is 27 years from now the future. In that sense, we want you to look

300
0:46:21.000 --> 0:46:29.640
into the future, look to the year 2050 and answer four questions. I'm going to give you the

301
0:46:29.640 --> 0:46:38.760
question and then give you the percentage answers that the American people gave. Question number one

302
0:46:39.720 --> 0:46:49.400
will the United States economy be weaker or stronger in 2050 compared to what it is today?

303
0:46:50.360 --> 0:46:57.800
66% of Americans said that the U.S. economy will be weaker.

304
0:46:59.160 --> 0:47:11.560
32% said it will be stronger. Two to one, over two to one, saying that they believe the United States

305
0:47:11.560 --> 0:47:19.640
would be weaker. In terms of today's presentation that the decline of the G7 in the view of most

306
0:47:19.640 --> 0:47:30.200
Americans will continue. Second question, will the United States be less important in the world

307
0:47:30.200 --> 0:47:41.160
or more important in the world in 2015 compared to now? 71% said that the United States will be

308
0:47:41.240 --> 0:47:49.080
less important than it is today. 27% said it would be more important.

309
0:47:51.800 --> 0:48:02.760
Third question, the United States will be more politically divided in 2050 or less politically divided.

310
0:48:03.640 --> 0:48:15.880
77% said more politically divided. 21% said less so. And the fourth and final question

311
0:48:17.080 --> 0:48:24.920
the gap between rich and poor in the United States will grow or it will get smaller.

312
0:48:24.920 --> 0:48:35.000
81% of the American people believe the gap between rich and poor will be worse will be larger

313
0:48:37.000 --> 0:48:48.040
in 2050 than it is today. I want to draw a conclusion in conclusion for today.

314
0:48:48.440 --> 0:48:59.640
The American people understand maybe not the facts in the figures, maybe not the particular details,

315
0:49:00.520 --> 0:49:09.960
maybe not the speed or rate at which the changes are happening. But they clearly understand

316
0:49:10.920 --> 0:49:22.360
that the world is changing in ways that diminish externally and internally what the United

317
0:49:22.360 --> 0:49:36.040
States once was and what it is fast becoming less of. And I want to contrast that with the

318
0:49:36.040 --> 0:49:47.000
statements and I believe the beliefs of the leaders of the United States. Not just the Republican

319
0:49:47.000 --> 0:49:58.040
and Democratic Party politician leaders but much of the mass media, much of the academic world,

320
0:49:58.040 --> 0:50:11.000
so they too are engaged in something which really has no nicer name than a massive quantity

321
0:50:11.000 --> 0:50:23.480
of denialism. They don't want to see what is going on or if they see it they pretend it isn't

322
0:50:23.560 --> 0:50:34.600
significant or if they can find some statistic that makes things look better they hype those statistics

323
0:50:34.600 --> 0:50:44.200
in order to avoid confronting the kinds of issues I have tried to present here. In some ways

324
0:50:44.200 --> 0:50:54.920
is even more impressive than the relative decline of the United States and the G7 relative to China

325
0:50:54.920 --> 0:51:05.080
and the breaks. Perhaps even more important in the long historical run will be this gap

326
0:51:05.080 --> 0:51:16.200
in the understanding and the consciousness of the people who have to live the decline versus the

327
0:51:16.200 --> 0:51:27.720
people who make their living pretending and insisting that that decline isn't happening or isn't

328
0:51:27.800 --> 0:51:40.520
going to have mammoth effects. My own conclusion and I leave you with that is that the pace of change

329
0:51:41.720 --> 0:51:53.320
the rise of the bricks, the collapse of the dollar, the rise of China, the outcome so far

330
0:51:53.400 --> 0:52:05.080
of the Ukraine war, these are powerful messages and measures of a fast changing global economy.

331
0:52:07.320 --> 0:52:17.560
A famous leader once said to his associates who were complaining that there wasn't enough change.

332
0:52:17.880 --> 0:52:34.040
He said to them, for decades nothing seems to happen, nothing much changes. Then in a few weeks

333
0:52:34.120 --> 0:52:46.600
decades happen. I'm quite convinced that in the world economy we now live in, we are experiencing

334
0:52:47.400 --> 0:52:57.560
weeks during which decades are happening. Thank you very much for your attention. I hope these

335
0:52:58.280 --> 0:53:07.320
presentations on global capitalism meet with your expectations and in any event. I look forward

336
0:53:07.320 --> 0:53:15.400
to being with you again for the next installment on the second Wednesday evening of the month of July

337
0:53:16.120 --> 0:53:18.920
2023. Thank you.
