1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:11.000
I'm running short of words right now, but I cannot afford this because I have to speak.

2
0:00:11.000 --> 0:00:16.000
Thank you so much for all the love, for all the warmth.

3
0:00:16.000 --> 0:00:20.000
Thank you for accepting me.

4
0:00:20.000 --> 0:00:22.000
Thank you very much.

5
0:00:30.000 --> 0:00:35.000
Well, I always start my talk with a disclaimer.

6
0:00:35.000 --> 0:00:39.000
And that disclaimer is that I've never claimed to be a motivational speaker.

7
0:00:39.000 --> 0:00:48.000
Yes, I do speak, but I feel more like a storyteller because wherever I go, I share my story with everyone.

8
0:00:48.000 --> 0:00:54.000
Well, it is a story of a woman who's perfectly imperfect life,

9
0:00:54.000 --> 0:00:58.000
and what she is today.

10
0:00:58.000 --> 0:01:05.000
It's the story of a woman who, in pursuit of her dreams and aspirations, made other people realize,

11
0:01:05.000 --> 0:01:09.000
that if you think that your life is hard and you're giving up on that,

12
0:01:09.000 --> 0:01:14.000
because you think your life is unfair, think again,

13
0:01:14.000 --> 0:01:20.000
because when you think that way you are being unfair to your own self,

14
0:01:21.000 --> 0:01:28.000
it's the story of a woman who made people realize that sometimes problems are not too big.

15
0:01:28.000 --> 0:01:33.000
We are too small because we cannot handle them.

16
0:01:33.000 --> 0:01:45.000
It is the story of a woman who, with time, realized,

17
0:01:45.000 --> 0:01:52.000
that the real happiness doesn't lie in success, money, fame.

18
0:01:52.000 --> 0:01:54.000
It lies within.

19
0:01:54.000 --> 0:01:59.000
The real happiness lies in gratitude.

20
0:01:59.000 --> 0:02:05.000
So I am here, and I'm going to share the story of that woman.

21
0:02:05.000 --> 0:02:07.000
That is my story.

22
0:02:07.000 --> 0:02:10.000
The story of gratitude.

23
0:02:16.000 --> 0:02:20.000
I love you too.

24
0:02:20.000 --> 0:02:25.000
I love you all.

25
0:02:25.000 --> 0:02:28.000
I believe in the power of words.

26
0:02:28.000 --> 0:02:31.000
Many people speak before they think,

27
0:02:31.000 --> 0:02:33.000
but I know the value of words.

28
0:02:33.000 --> 0:02:35.000
The words can make you break you.

29
0:02:35.000 --> 0:02:36.000
They can heal your soul.

30
0:02:36.000 --> 0:02:38.000
They can damage you forever.

31
0:02:38.000 --> 0:02:41.000
So I always try to use the positive words in my life.

32
0:02:41.000 --> 0:02:44.000
Wherever I go, they call it adversity.

33
0:02:44.000 --> 0:02:45.000
I call it opportunity.

34
0:02:45.000 --> 0:02:46.000
They call it weakness.

35
0:02:46.000 --> 0:02:48.000
I call it strength.

36
0:02:48.000 --> 0:02:49.000
They call me disabled.

37
0:02:49.000 --> 0:02:51.000
I call myself differently.

38
0:02:51.000 --> 0:02:58.000
They see my disability.

39
0:02:58.000 --> 0:03:03.000
They see my disability.

40
0:03:03.000 --> 0:03:06.000
There are some incidents that happen in your life.

41
0:03:06.000 --> 0:03:13.000
And those incidents are so strong that they change your DNA.

42
0:03:14.000 --> 0:03:19.000
Those incidents are so strong that they break you physically.

43
0:03:19.000 --> 0:03:28.000
They deform your body, but they transform your soul.

44
0:03:28.000 --> 0:03:36.000
Those incidents break you, deform you, but they mold you into the best version of you.

45
0:03:36.000 --> 0:03:39.000
And the same thing happened to me.

46
0:03:39.000 --> 0:03:43.000
And I'm going to share what exactly happened to me.

47
0:03:43.000 --> 0:03:46.000
I was 18 years old when I got married.

48
0:03:46.000 --> 0:03:50.000
And this thing I'm sharing for the very first time one in international level.

49
0:03:50.000 --> 0:03:52.000
I was 18 years old when I got married.

50
0:03:52.000 --> 0:03:59.000
I belonged to a very conservative family, a bloch family, where good daughters never say no to their parents.

51
0:03:59.000 --> 0:04:02.000
My father wanted me to get married.

52
0:04:02.000 --> 0:04:06.000
And all I said was, if that makes you happy, I'll say yes.

53
0:04:06.000 --> 0:04:11.000
And of course, it was never a happy marriage.

54
0:04:11.000 --> 0:04:21.000
Just about after two years of getting married, about nine years ago, I met a car accident.

55
0:04:21.000 --> 0:04:30.000
Somehow my husband fell asleep and the car fell in the ditch.

56
0:04:30.000 --> 0:04:34.000
He managed to jump out, saved himself, I'm happy for him.

57
0:04:34.000 --> 0:04:40.000
But I stayed inside the car and I sustained a lot of injuries.

58
0:04:40.000 --> 0:04:42.000
The list is a bit long, don't get scared.

59
0:04:42.000 --> 0:04:45.000
I'm perfectly fine now.

60
0:04:45.000 --> 0:04:48.000
Radius, a lot of my right arm were fractured.

61
0:04:48.000 --> 0:04:51.000
The wrist was fractured.

62
0:04:51.000 --> 0:04:54.000
Showed the bone and collar bone were fractured.

63
0:04:54.000 --> 0:04:56.000
My whole ribcage got fractured.

64
0:04:56.000 --> 0:05:03.000
And because of the ribcage injury, lungs and liver were badly injured.

65
0:05:03.000 --> 0:05:06.000
I couldn't breathe.

66
0:05:06.000 --> 0:05:08.000
I lost a urinal bowel control.

67
0:05:08.000 --> 0:05:12.000
That's why I have to wear the bag wherever I go.

68
0:05:12.000 --> 0:05:16.000
But that injury that changed me and my life completely.

69
0:05:16.000 --> 0:05:21.000
As a person and my perception towards living my life was the spine injury.

70
0:05:21.000 --> 0:05:25.000
Three-wirti bra of my backbone were completely crushed.

71
0:05:25.000 --> 0:05:30.000
And I got paralyzed for the rest of my life.

72
0:05:30.000 --> 0:05:36.000
So this accident took place in a far, flung area in the outskirts of a very small province,

73
0:05:36.000 --> 0:05:41.000
Balochistan where there was no first aid, no hospital, no ambulance.

74
0:05:41.000 --> 0:05:46.000
I was in the middle of nowhere in that toppled car.

75
0:05:46.000 --> 0:05:50.000
Many people came to rescue the gave me CPR.

76
0:05:50.000 --> 0:05:52.000
The dragged me out of the car.

77
0:05:52.000 --> 0:05:58.000
And while they were dragging me out, I got the complete transaction of my spinal cord.

78
0:05:59.000 --> 0:06:01.000
And now there was this debate going on.

79
0:06:01.000 --> 0:06:02.000
Should we keep it here?

80
0:06:02.000 --> 0:06:03.000
She's going to die.

81
0:06:03.000 --> 0:06:04.000
Where should we go?

82
0:06:04.000 --> 0:06:06.000
There is no ambulance.

83
0:06:06.000 --> 0:06:09.000
There was this four-wheeler jeep standing in the corner of the street.

84
0:06:09.000 --> 0:06:17.000
They said, put her in the back of the jeep and take her to the hospital, which is three hours away from this place.

85
0:06:17.000 --> 0:06:20.000
And I still remember that bumpy ride.

86
0:06:20.000 --> 0:06:22.000
I was all broken.

87
0:06:22.000 --> 0:06:26.000
They threw me at the back of the jeep and they rushed me to the hospital.

88
0:06:26.000 --> 0:06:34.000
That is where I realized that my half body was fractured and half was paralyzed.

89
0:06:34.000 --> 0:06:40.000
I finally ended up in a hospital where I stayed for two and a half months.

90
0:06:40.000 --> 0:06:42.000
I underwent multiple surgeries.

91
0:06:42.000 --> 0:06:46.000
Doctors have put a lot of titanium in my arm.

92
0:06:46.000 --> 0:06:49.000
There's a lot of titanium at my back to fix my back.

93
0:06:49.000 --> 0:06:53.000
That's why people in Pakistan call me the iron lady of Pakistan.

94
0:06:53.000 --> 0:07:05.000
Sometimes I wonder how easy it is for me to describe all this all over again.

95
0:07:05.000 --> 0:07:12.000
And somebody has rightly said that when you share your story and it doesn't make you cry, that means you have healed.

96
0:07:12.000 --> 0:07:24.000
Those two and a half months in the hospital were dreadful.

97
0:07:24.000 --> 0:07:28.000
I will not make up stories just to inspire you.

98
0:07:28.000 --> 0:07:31.000
I was at the verge of despair.

99
0:07:31.000 --> 0:07:38.000
One day, doctor came to me and he said, well, I heard that you wanted to be an artist, but you ended up being a housewife.

100
0:07:38.000 --> 0:07:40.000
I have a bad news for you.

101
0:07:41.000 --> 0:07:45.000
You won't be able to paint again because your wrist and your arm are so deformed.

102
0:07:45.000 --> 0:07:48.000
You won't be able to hold a pen again.

103
0:07:48.000 --> 0:07:50.000
And I stayed quiet.

104
0:07:50.000 --> 0:07:56.000
Next day, doctor came to me and said, you spine injury is so bad.

105
0:07:56.000 --> 0:07:59.000
You won't be able to walk again.

106
0:07:59.000 --> 0:08:04.000
I took a deep breath and I said, it's all right.

107
0:08:04.000 --> 0:08:09.000
The red day, doctor came to me and said, because if you're spine injury and the fixed face,

108
0:08:09.000 --> 0:08:17.000
you're a spine injury and the fixation that you have in your back, you won't be able to give birth to a child again.

109
0:08:17.000 --> 0:08:20.000
That day, I was devastated.

110
0:08:20.000 --> 0:08:27.000
I still remember, I asked my mother, why me?

111
0:08:27.000 --> 0:08:33.000
And that is where I started to question my existence, why am I even alive?

112
0:08:33.000 --> 0:08:36.000
What's the point of living?

113
0:08:36.000 --> 0:08:40.000
I cannot walk, I cannot paint fine, I cannot be a mother.

114
0:08:40.000 --> 0:08:45.000
And we have this thing in our heads being women that we are incomplete without.

115
0:08:45.000 --> 0:08:49.000
Having children, I am going to be an incomplete woman for the rest of my life.

116
0:08:49.000 --> 0:08:50.000
What's the point?

117
0:08:50.000 --> 0:08:51.000
People are scared.

118
0:08:51.000 --> 0:08:54.000
They think I will get divorced.

119
0:08:54.000 --> 0:08:56.000
What is going to happen to me?

120
0:08:56.000 --> 0:08:57.000
Why me?

121
0:08:57.000 --> 0:08:59.000
Why am I alive?

122
0:08:59.000 --> 0:09:02.000
We all try to chase the stunner.

123
0:09:02.000 --> 0:09:05.000
We all do this because we see light in the end of the tunnel,

124
0:09:05.000 --> 0:09:08.000
which keeps us going.

125
0:09:08.000 --> 0:09:13.000
My dear friends, in my situation, there was a tunnel that I had to roll on,

126
0:09:13.000 --> 0:09:16.000
but there was no light.

127
0:09:16.000 --> 0:09:22.000
And that is where I realized that the words have the power to heal the soul.

128
0:09:22.000 --> 0:09:28.000
My mother said to me, this two shell pass.

129
0:09:28.000 --> 0:09:31.000
God has a greater plan for you.

130
0:09:31.000 --> 0:09:35.000
I don't know what it is, but he surely has.

131
0:09:35.000 --> 0:09:48.000
I mean, all that distress and grief somehow are the other of those words were so magical

132
0:09:48.000 --> 0:09:51.000
that they kept me going.

133
0:09:51.000 --> 0:09:54.000
I was trying to put that smile on my face all the time.

134
0:09:54.000 --> 0:09:59.000
It was so hard to hide the pain, which was there.

135
0:10:00.000 --> 0:10:06.000
But all I knew was that if I will give up, my mother and my brothers will give up too.

136
0:10:06.000 --> 0:10:09.000
I cannot see them crying with me.

137
0:10:09.000 --> 0:10:13.000
So what kept me going was, when they asked my brothers,

138
0:10:13.000 --> 0:10:20.000
I know I have a deformed hand, but I'm tired of looking at these white walls in the hospital

139
0:10:20.000 --> 0:10:22.000
and wearing these white scrubs.

140
0:10:22.000 --> 0:10:23.000
I'm getting tired of this.

141
0:10:23.000 --> 0:10:25.000
I want to add more colors to my life.

142
0:10:25.000 --> 0:10:26.000
I want to do something.

143
0:10:26.000 --> 0:10:27.000
Bring me some colors.

144
0:10:27.000 --> 0:10:29.000
Bring me some small canvas.

145
0:10:29.000 --> 0:10:30.000
I want to paint.

146
0:10:30.000 --> 0:10:36.000
So the very first painting I made was on my dead bed.

147
0:10:36.000 --> 0:10:41.000
Where I painted for the very first time.

148
0:10:41.000 --> 0:10:44.000
It was not just an art piece or just my fashion.

149
0:10:44.000 --> 0:10:46.000
It was my therapy.

150
0:10:46.000 --> 0:10:50.000
What an amazing therapy it was without a single word.

151
0:10:50.000 --> 0:10:52.000
I could paint my heart out.

152
0:10:52.000 --> 0:10:54.000
I could share my story.

153
0:10:55.000 --> 0:10:59.000
People used to come and say, what lovely painting, so much color.

154
0:10:59.000 --> 0:11:01.000
Nobody could see the grief in it.

155
0:11:01.000 --> 0:11:04.000
Only I could.

156
0:11:04.000 --> 0:11:08.000
So that's how I spent two and a half months in my hospital.

157
0:11:08.000 --> 0:11:09.000
Crying.

158
0:11:09.000 --> 0:11:11.000
Never complaining or whining.

159
0:11:11.000 --> 0:11:13.000
But painting.

160
0:11:13.000 --> 0:11:17.000
And then I was discharged and I went back home.

161
0:11:17.000 --> 0:11:22.000
And I went back home and I realized that I have developed a lot of pressure ulcers on my back

162
0:11:23.000 --> 0:11:26.000
and on my hip bone I was unable to sit.

163
0:11:26.000 --> 0:11:30.000
There were a lot of infections in my body, a lot of allergies.

164
0:11:30.000 --> 0:11:34.000
So doctors wanted me to lie down on the bed straight.

165
0:11:34.000 --> 0:11:38.000
For not six months, for not one year.

166
0:11:38.000 --> 0:11:41.000
For two years, I was bedridden.

167
0:11:41.000 --> 0:11:43.000
Confine in that one room.

168
0:11:43.000 --> 0:11:46.000
Looking outside the window.

169
0:11:46.000 --> 0:11:48.000
Listening to the birds chirping.

170
0:11:48.000 --> 0:11:51.000
And thinking maybe there will be a time when really going out.

171
0:11:51.000 --> 0:11:55.000
With the family and enjoying the nature.

172
0:11:55.000 --> 0:12:00.000
That was the time where I realized how lucky people are.

173
0:12:00.000 --> 0:12:06.000
But they don't realize.

174
0:12:06.000 --> 0:12:11.000
That is the time where I realized that the day I'm going to sit,

175
0:12:11.000 --> 0:12:16.000
I'm going to share this pain with everyone to make them realize how blessed they are.

176
0:12:16.000 --> 0:12:19.000
And they don't even consider them lucky.

177
0:12:21.000 --> 0:12:26.000
There are always turning points in your life.

178
0:12:26.000 --> 0:12:32.000
There was a rebirth day that I celebrated.

179
0:12:32.000 --> 0:12:38.000
After two years and two and a half months, when I was able to sit on a wheelchair,

180
0:12:38.000 --> 0:12:42.000
that was the day when I had the rebirth.

181
0:12:42.000 --> 0:12:44.000
I was a completely different person.

182
0:12:44.000 --> 0:12:49.000
I still remember the day I sat on the wheelchair for the first time knowing that I'm never going to leave this,

183
0:12:49.000 --> 0:12:52.000
knowing that I won't be able to walk for the rest of my life.

184
0:12:52.000 --> 0:12:58.000
I saw myself in the mirror and I talked to myself.

185
0:12:58.000 --> 0:13:01.000
And I still remember what I said.

186
0:13:01.000 --> 0:13:06.000
I cannot wait for a miracle to come and make me walk.

187
0:13:06.000 --> 0:13:08.000
I cannot sit in the corner of the room crying,

188
0:13:08.000 --> 0:13:12.000
cribbing and begging for mercy because nobody has time.

189
0:13:12.000 --> 0:13:17.000
So I have to accept myself the way I am, the sooner the better.

190
0:13:18.000 --> 0:13:21.000
So I applied the lip color for the first time.

191
0:13:27.000 --> 0:13:29.000
And now you raised it.

192
0:13:29.000 --> 0:13:33.000
And I cried and I said, what am I doing?

193
0:13:33.000 --> 0:13:36.000
A person on a wheelchair should not do this.

194
0:13:36.000 --> 0:13:38.000
What will people say?

195
0:13:38.000 --> 0:13:40.000
Clean it up.

196
0:13:40.000 --> 0:13:42.000
Put it again.

197
0:13:42.000 --> 0:13:44.000
This time I put it for myself.

198
0:13:44.000 --> 0:13:47.000
Because I wanted to feel perfect from within.

199
0:13:55.000 --> 0:13:59.000
And that day I decided that I'm going to live life for myself.

200
0:13:59.000 --> 0:14:03.000
I am not going to be that perfect person for someone.

201
0:14:03.000 --> 0:14:08.000
I am just going to take this moment and I will make it perfect for myself.

202
0:14:08.000 --> 0:14:11.000
And you know how it all began?

203
0:14:12.000 --> 0:14:15.000
That day I decided that I'm going to fight my fears.

204
0:14:15.000 --> 0:14:17.000
We all have fears.

205
0:14:17.000 --> 0:14:19.000
Fear of unknown.

206
0:14:19.000 --> 0:14:20.000
Fear of known.

207
0:14:20.000 --> 0:14:22.000
Fear of losing people.

208
0:14:22.000 --> 0:14:24.000
Fear of losing health.

209
0:14:24.000 --> 0:14:25.000
Money.

210
0:14:25.000 --> 0:14:27.000
We want to excel in career.

211
0:14:27.000 --> 0:14:28.000
We want to become famous.

212
0:14:28.000 --> 0:14:29.000
We want to get money.

213
0:14:29.000 --> 0:14:31.000
We are scared all the time.

214
0:14:31.000 --> 0:14:33.000
So I wrote down one by one.

215
0:14:33.000 --> 0:14:35.000
All those fears.

216
0:14:35.000 --> 0:14:39.000
And I decided that I'm going to overcome these fears one at a time.

217
0:14:39.000 --> 0:14:42.000
You know what was my biggest fear?

218
0:14:42.000 --> 0:14:45.000
Divorce.

219
0:14:45.000 --> 0:14:48.000
I couldn't stand this word.

220
0:14:48.000 --> 0:14:52.000
I was trying to cling onto this person who didn't want me anymore.

221
0:14:52.000 --> 0:14:54.000
But I said no.

222
0:14:54.000 --> 0:14:56.000
I have to make it work.

223
0:14:56.000 --> 0:15:00.000
But the day I decided that this is nothing but my fear.

224
0:15:00.000 --> 0:15:03.000
I liberated myself by setting him free.

225
0:15:03.000 --> 0:15:08.000
And I made myself emotionally so strong that the day I got the news that he's getting married.

226
0:15:08.000 --> 0:15:13.000
I sent him a text that I'm so happy for you and I wish you all the best.

227
0:15:13.000 --> 0:15:16.000
And he knows that I pray for him today.

228
0:15:16.000 --> 0:15:20.000
My biggest fear.

229
0:15:20.000 --> 0:15:25.000
Number two was I won't be able to be a mother again.

230
0:15:25.000 --> 0:15:29.000
And that was quite devastating for me.

231
0:15:29.000 --> 0:15:37.000
But then I realized there are so many children in the world all they want is acceptance.

232
0:15:38.000 --> 0:15:42.000
So there is no point of crying just going adopt one.

233
0:15:42.000 --> 0:15:45.000
And that's what I did.

234
0:15:53.000 --> 0:15:57.000
I gave my name in different organizations different orphanages.

235
0:15:57.000 --> 0:16:01.000
I didn't mention that I'm one wheelchair dying to have a child.

236
0:16:01.000 --> 0:16:05.000
So I just told them that this is Winnie Vermezery and she wants to adopt a boy or girl.

237
0:16:05.000 --> 0:16:08.000
What's so ever but I want to adopt a kid.

238
0:16:08.000 --> 0:16:10.000
And I waited patiently.

239
0:16:10.000 --> 0:16:14.000
Two years later I got this call from a very small sitting Pakistan.

240
0:16:14.000 --> 0:16:16.000
I got a call and they said, are you Minibu Vermezery?

241
0:16:16.000 --> 0:16:20.000
The reason for the baby boy and would you like to adopt?

242
0:16:20.000 --> 0:16:24.000
And when I say yes, I could literally feel the labour pain.

243
0:16:24.000 --> 0:16:27.000
I said yes, yes, I am going to adopt him.

244
0:16:27.000 --> 0:16:29.000
I am coming to take him home.

245
0:16:36.000 --> 0:16:41.000
And when I reached there, the man was sitting and he was looking at me from head to toe.

246
0:16:41.000 --> 0:16:44.000
And in back of my head I kept thinking that oh my god.

247
0:16:44.000 --> 0:16:47.000
He is going to say she is on the wheelchair.

248
0:16:47.000 --> 0:16:48.000
She doesn't deserve it.

249
0:16:48.000 --> 0:16:50.000
How is she going to take care of him?

250
0:16:50.000 --> 0:16:53.000
And I looked at him and I said, do not judge me because I am on the wheelchair.

251
0:16:53.000 --> 0:16:55.000
But you know where he said.

252
0:16:55.000 --> 0:16:59.000
He said, I know you will be the best mother of this child.

253
0:16:59.000 --> 0:17:01.000
You both are lucky to have each other.

254
0:17:05.000 --> 0:17:20.000
And that day, I was two years old, two days old and today he is six.

255
0:17:20.000 --> 0:17:24.000
You will be surprised to know another big fear that I had in me.

256
0:17:24.000 --> 0:17:26.000
It was facing people.

257
0:17:26.000 --> 0:17:29.000
I used to hide myself from people.

258
0:17:29.000 --> 0:17:32.000
When I was on bed for two years, I used to keep the door closed.

259
0:17:32.000 --> 0:17:36.000
I used to pretend that I am not going to meet anyone telling that I am sleeping.

260
0:17:36.000 --> 0:17:38.000
You know why?

261
0:17:38.000 --> 0:17:42.000
Because I couldn't stand that sympathy that they had for me.

262
0:17:42.000 --> 0:17:45.000
They used to treat me like a patient.

263
0:17:45.000 --> 0:17:47.000
When I used to smile, they used to look at me and say that.

264
0:17:47.000 --> 0:17:48.000
You are smiling.

265
0:17:48.000 --> 0:17:49.000
Are you okay?

266
0:17:49.000 --> 0:17:52.000
I was tired of this question being asked.

267
0:17:52.000 --> 0:17:53.000
Are you sick?

268
0:17:53.000 --> 0:17:55.000
Well, a lady yesterday at the airport asked me.

269
0:17:55.000 --> 0:17:56.000
Are you sick?

270
0:17:56.000 --> 0:18:00.000
And as well besides the spinal cord injury, I am fine.

271
0:18:00.000 --> 0:18:01.000
I guess?

272
0:18:01.000 --> 0:18:09.000
But those are really cute questions.

273
0:18:09.000 --> 0:18:12.000
They never used to feel cute when I was on the bed.

274
0:18:12.000 --> 0:18:17.000
So I used to hide myself from people, knowing that, oh my God, I am not going to see that sympathy

275
0:18:17.000 --> 0:18:18.000
in their eyes.

276
0:18:18.000 --> 0:18:19.000
It is all right.

277
0:18:19.000 --> 0:18:25.000
And today I am here speaking to all these amazing people because I have overcome the fear.

278
0:18:25.000 --> 0:18:38.000
You know when you end up being on the wheelchair, what is the most painful thing?

279
0:18:38.000 --> 0:18:44.000
That is another fear that people on the wheelchair or the people who are differently abled, having their hearts

280
0:18:44.000 --> 0:18:45.000
but they never share.

281
0:18:45.000 --> 0:18:46.000
I will share that with you.

282
0:18:46.000 --> 0:18:48.000
The lack of acceptance.

283
0:18:48.000 --> 0:18:54.000
People think that they will not be accepted by the people because we, in the world of perfect people,

284
0:18:54.000 --> 0:18:55.000
are imperfect.

285
0:18:55.000 --> 0:19:02.000
So I decided that instead of starting an NGO for disability awareness, which I know will not help anyone,

286
0:19:02.000 --> 0:19:05.000
I started to appear more in public.

287
0:19:05.000 --> 0:19:07.000
I started to paint.

288
0:19:07.000 --> 0:19:08.000
I always wanted to.

289
0:19:08.000 --> 0:19:10.000
I have done a lot of exhibitions.

290
0:19:10.000 --> 0:19:12.000
I am Pakistan's first wheelchair about artists.

291
0:19:12.000 --> 0:19:15.000
I have done a lot of modeling campaigns.

292
0:19:15.000 --> 0:19:18.000
Different campaigns for brands like Tony and Guy.

293
0:19:19.000 --> 0:19:28.000
I have done some really funny breaking the barriers kind of modeling.

294
0:19:28.000 --> 0:19:37.000
There was this one by the name Clown Town where I became a clown because I know that clowns have hearts too.

295
0:19:37.000 --> 0:19:46.000
And then I also decided that if I really want to make the difference, I am not going to let people use me for their polio campaigns,

296
0:19:46.000 --> 0:19:50.000
they will make you a victim at an emblem of misery and mercy.

297
0:19:50.000 --> 0:19:51.000
And we will say that you know what?

298
0:19:51.000 --> 0:19:54.000
Give polio drops to your children all they will become like this girl.

299
0:19:54.000 --> 0:19:59.000
I decided that I am going to join the National TV of Pakistan as an anchor person.

300
0:19:59.000 --> 0:20:11.000
And I have been doing a lot of shows for last three years.

301
0:20:11.000 --> 0:20:15.000
When you accept yourself the way you are, the world recognizes you.

302
0:20:15.000 --> 0:20:18.000
It all starts from within.

303
0:20:18.000 --> 0:20:21.000
I became, thank you.

304
0:20:21.000 --> 0:20:24.000
I became the National Woodville Ambassador for you and women Pakistan.

305
0:20:24.000 --> 0:20:27.000
And now I speak for the rights of women, children.

306
0:20:27.000 --> 0:20:32.000
We talk about inclusion, diversity, gender equality, which is a must.

307
0:20:32.000 --> 0:20:37.000
I was featured in BBC 100 Women for 2015.

308
0:20:37.000 --> 0:20:44.000
I am one of the Forbes 30 and a 30 for 2016.

309
0:20:44.000 --> 0:20:47.000
And it all didn't happen alone.

310
0:20:47.000 --> 0:20:50.000
You all are thriving in your careers.

311
0:20:50.000 --> 0:20:52.000
You have bigger dreams and aspirations in life.

312
0:20:52.000 --> 0:20:54.000
Always remember one thing.

313
0:20:54.000 --> 0:21:00.000
On the road to success, there is always we, not me.

314
0:21:00.000 --> 0:21:03.000
Do not think that you alone can achieve things.

315
0:21:03.000 --> 0:21:04.000
No.

316
0:21:05.000 --> 0:21:11.000
There is always another person who is standing behind you, maybe not coming on the forefront, but behind you,

317
0:21:11.000 --> 0:21:17.000
praying for you and supporting you, never lose that person, never.

318
0:21:23.000 --> 0:21:28.000
No matter how much I say, that I couldn't find a hero so I became one,

319
0:21:28.000 --> 0:21:33.000
I still want to recognize those three people in my life who literally changed my life completely.

320
0:21:34.000 --> 0:21:38.000
And I get inspiration from them every single day.

321
0:21:38.000 --> 0:21:43.000
Wally Than.

322
0:21:43.000 --> 0:21:47.000
Many people know about the terrorist attacks in Pakistan.

323
0:21:47.000 --> 0:21:50.000
We have lost many people.

324
0:21:50.000 --> 0:21:55.000
And I'm sure in this with a very heavy heart because we actually have lost a lot of people.

325
0:21:55.000 --> 0:21:59.000
In this huge turmoil of terrorism.

326
0:21:59.000 --> 0:22:01.000
These people are barbarians.

327
0:22:01.000 --> 0:22:04.000
They do not see people.

328
0:22:04.000 --> 0:22:07.000
They are even worse than animals.

329
0:22:07.000 --> 0:22:09.000
They have killed people in mosques.

330
0:22:09.000 --> 0:22:13.000
They have killed people in churches, temples, even in schools.

331
0:22:13.000 --> 0:22:18.000
There was this terrorist attack in Army Public School, Peshawar.

332
0:22:18.000 --> 0:22:26.000
Where these terrorists entered in an examination hall and they killed our children.

333
0:22:27.000 --> 0:22:34.000
And in that attack that day, this beautiful boy, Wally Than, who was my hero, my real life hero,

334
0:22:34.000 --> 0:22:40.000
was the proctor who was taking care of the students, who was keeping an eye on the students.

335
0:22:40.000 --> 0:22:47.000
Those barbarians shot him three times in the face, five times on his body, and he fell down.

336
0:22:49.000 --> 0:22:54.000
I was asked to give a talk in the school after a week of that terrorist attack.

337
0:22:54.000 --> 0:22:57.000
With a very heavy heart, I went there and I spoke.

338
0:22:57.000 --> 0:22:59.000
We sang a few national songs.

339
0:22:59.000 --> 0:23:03.000
I thought that maybe I've done my part, but deep inside, it was killing me.

340
0:23:03.000 --> 0:23:06.000
I could see children injured.

341
0:23:06.000 --> 0:23:10.000
I could see children sitting on the wheel chair looking at me wondering,

342
0:23:10.000 --> 0:23:13.000
what next?

343
0:23:13.000 --> 0:23:14.000
What was our fault?

344
0:23:14.000 --> 0:23:17.000
Just because we were here to give examination.

345
0:23:17.000 --> 0:23:18.000
We have been shot.

346
0:23:18.000 --> 0:23:20.000
So many people.

347
0:23:20.000 --> 0:23:22.000
So many children lost their friends.

348
0:23:22.000 --> 0:23:26.000
The classrooms were empty. The next day they went to the classroom.

349
0:23:26.000 --> 0:23:32.000
So this kid Wally Than, I was asked that he is in a hospital right now,

350
0:23:32.000 --> 0:23:38.000
and you have to go and see him and motivate him and tell him that it's going to be okay.

351
0:23:38.000 --> 0:23:43.000
And when I saw Wally Than coming on the wheelchair for the first time in front of me,

352
0:23:43.000 --> 0:23:46.000
face was all deformed.

353
0:23:46.000 --> 0:23:49.000
His leg was fractured, his arm was fractured.

354
0:23:49.000 --> 0:23:52.000
He couldn't talk, he lost his teeth.

355
0:23:52.000 --> 0:23:55.000
He cannot sneeze, he cannot smell.

356
0:23:55.000 --> 0:23:58.000
He cannot eat.

357
0:23:58.000 --> 0:24:02.000
And I kept thinking, what should I say?

358
0:24:02.000 --> 0:24:05.000
That everything is going to be alright, no.

359
0:24:05.000 --> 0:24:07.000
Nothing is alright.

360
0:24:07.000 --> 0:24:14.000
And while I was juggling with the words, what to say, what not to say this beautiful child, Wally Than,

361
0:24:14.000 --> 0:24:17.000
came to me and he said, are you Munibam Azari?

362
0:24:17.000 --> 0:24:19.000
He said, yes.

363
0:24:19.000 --> 0:24:21.000
He said, budge, let's take a selfie.

364
0:24:21.000 --> 0:24:37.000
And with that beautiful, toothless smile of Wally Than, we took that beautiful selfie that I still have with me.

365
0:24:37.000 --> 0:24:42.000
I don't share that here because he was in a very bad shape that time.

366
0:24:42.000 --> 0:24:49.000
And that is where I realized that when I was thinking too much about his deformities, he's happy with himself.

367
0:24:49.000 --> 0:24:51.000
He doesn't even care.

368
0:24:51.000 --> 0:24:55.000
Because today he goes in the same school.

369
0:24:55.000 --> 0:24:58.000
And when somebody asks him that what happened to your face, why so many scars?

370
0:24:58.000 --> 0:25:01.000
You know what he says?

371
0:25:01.000 --> 0:25:05.000
These scars are my medals and I wear them with pride.

372
0:25:05.000 --> 0:25:22.000
And how beautifully he says that terrorists wanted me not to study, I am going to study, I will become a doctor one day.

373
0:25:22.000 --> 0:25:30.000
And this is my way of taking revenge from those terrorists.

374
0:25:31.000 --> 0:25:40.000
Another real life hero, of course, my son, his name is Nile and I L.A. River Nile.

375
0:25:40.000 --> 0:25:43.000
I learned so much from this kid.

376
0:25:43.000 --> 0:25:47.000
The first and foremost thing is patience.

377
0:25:47.000 --> 0:25:52.000
How to be patient when you know that your mother cannot walk,

378
0:25:52.000 --> 0:25:55.000
when you know that your mother is different from the other women.

379
0:25:55.000 --> 0:26:00.000
When you know that your mother cannot go out and play with you, how to stay calm.

380
0:26:00.000 --> 0:26:03.000
He loves football.

381
0:26:03.000 --> 0:26:06.000
And when we got the very first football he was four years old.

382
0:26:06.000 --> 0:26:08.000
He was super excited.

383
0:26:08.000 --> 0:26:13.000
I still remember he came in the room and he said, mom, let's play football.

384
0:26:13.000 --> 0:26:16.000
And he kept the ball in my feet.

385
0:26:16.000 --> 0:26:19.000
And he said, let's kick it.

386
0:26:19.000 --> 0:26:23.000
And that day I felt disabled.

387
0:26:24.000 --> 0:26:26.000
I said, I cannot kick the ball.

388
0:26:26.000 --> 0:26:32.000
And I was down with the same face. He looked at me and he said, well, that's all right.

389
0:26:32.000 --> 0:26:36.000
Your legs are not working but your hands too. Let's play catch the ball.

390
0:26:37.000 --> 0:26:49.000
You know what that day he made me realize that when you think your glass is half empty,

391
0:26:49.000 --> 0:26:52.000
come on, your glass is half full.

392
0:26:52.000 --> 0:26:55.000
It's all in here and here.

393
0:26:55.000 --> 0:27:05.000
Last but not least, the woman who made me realize that heroes have no gender.

394
0:27:06.000 --> 0:27:14.000
The woman who believed in me even when I was completely at the words of despair, where everybody left.

395
0:27:14.000 --> 0:27:16.000
She was there.

396
0:27:16.000 --> 0:27:22.000
And every time I looked at her without saying anything, she used to look at me and said, this two shell pass.

397
0:27:22.000 --> 0:27:24.000
God has a bigger plan.

398
0:27:24.000 --> 0:27:29.000
And one day you will say that, oh my God, that is why God has chosen me.

399
0:27:29.000 --> 0:27:31.000
She never cried in front of me.

400
0:27:31.000 --> 0:27:36.000
She has always said that there will be haters, there will be naysayers, there will be disbelievers.

401
0:27:36.000 --> 0:27:39.000
And then there will be you proving them wrong.

402
0:27:39.000 --> 0:27:41.000
My mother.

403
0:27:47.000 --> 0:27:52.000
Whatever I am today, I'm nothing without her.

404
0:27:52.000 --> 0:27:55.000
I'm nothing without her.

405
0:27:55.000 --> 0:28:00.000
Thank you, Mama. I wish you were here. Thank you for making me. I am today.

406
0:28:01.000 --> 0:28:09.000
You know what we human beings have a problem.

407
0:28:09.000 --> 0:28:12.000
Out of many problems, there is one more.

408
0:28:12.000 --> 0:28:17.000
And this is self-created one.

409
0:28:17.000 --> 0:28:21.000
We always expect ease from life.

410
0:28:21.000 --> 0:28:26.000
We have this amazing fantasy about life.

411
0:28:26.000 --> 0:28:28.000
This is how things should work.

412
0:28:28.000 --> 0:28:32.000
This is my plan. It should go as per my plan.

413
0:28:32.000 --> 0:28:36.000
If that doesn't happen, we give up.

414
0:28:36.000 --> 0:28:38.000
So my dear friends, let me tell you one thing.

415
0:28:38.000 --> 0:28:41.000
I never wanted to be on the wheelchair.

416
0:28:41.000 --> 0:28:44.000
Never thought of being on the wheelchair.

417
0:28:44.000 --> 0:28:52.000
I was always aspiring to do bigger things but had no idea that for that I have to pay the price to be where I am today.

418
0:28:52.000 --> 0:28:55.000
It's a very heavy price.

419
0:28:55.000 --> 0:28:59.000
This life is a test and a trial and tests are trials.

420
0:28:59.000 --> 0:29:01.000
I never suppose to be easy.

421
0:29:01.000 --> 0:29:05.000
So when you are expecting ease from life,

422
0:29:05.000 --> 0:29:08.000
and life gives you lemons, then you make the lemonade,

423
0:29:08.000 --> 0:29:10.000
and then do not blame life for that.

424
0:29:10.000 --> 0:29:13.000
Because you were expecting ease from a trial.

425
0:29:13.000 --> 0:29:18.000
Trials make you a stronger, better person.

426
0:29:18.000 --> 0:29:20.000
Life is a trial.

427
0:29:20.000 --> 0:29:23.000
And we time you realize that.

428
0:29:25.000 --> 0:29:32.000
It is okay to be scared.

429
0:29:32.000 --> 0:29:36.000
It is okay to cry.

430
0:29:36.000 --> 0:29:37.000
Everything is okay.

431
0:29:37.000 --> 0:29:40.000
But giving up should not be an option.

432
0:29:40.000 --> 0:29:44.000
They always say that failure is not an option.

433
0:29:44.000 --> 0:29:47.000
Failure should be an option because when you fail,

434
0:29:47.000 --> 0:29:52.000
you get up and then you fail and then you get up and that keeps you going.

435
0:29:52.000 --> 0:29:55.000
That's how humans are strong.

436
0:29:55.000 --> 0:30:01.000
Failure is an option.

437
0:30:01.000 --> 0:30:04.000
Should be an option but giving up is not.

438
0:30:04.000 --> 0:30:06.000
Never.

439
0:30:06.000 --> 0:30:08.000
We have this thing in mind.

440
0:30:08.000 --> 0:30:10.000
We call it perfection.

441
0:30:10.000 --> 0:30:12.000
We want everything.

442
0:30:12.000 --> 0:30:14.000
We want ourselves to be perfect.

443
0:30:14.000 --> 0:30:17.000
There is this image in our head about everything.

444
0:30:17.000 --> 0:30:18.000
Perfect life.

445
0:30:18.000 --> 0:30:19.000
Perfect relationships.

446
0:30:19.000 --> 0:30:20.000
Perfect career.

447
0:30:21.000 --> 0:30:25.000
Perfect amount of money that we need to earn no matter what.

448
0:30:25.000 --> 0:30:27.000
Nothing is perfect in this world.

449
0:30:27.000 --> 0:30:32.000
We all are perfectly imperfect and that is perfectly all right.

450
0:30:32.000 --> 0:30:35.000
That's all right.

451
0:30:35.000 --> 0:30:39.000
You were sent here not to become the perfect people.

452
0:30:39.000 --> 0:30:44.000
Those people who tell you how to look perfect even those people are imperfect.

453
0:30:44.000 --> 0:30:48.000
Trying to fight this fear of looking imperfect.

454
0:30:48.000 --> 0:30:49.000
I used to be perfect.

455
0:30:49.000 --> 0:30:51.000
I still remember.

456
0:30:51.000 --> 0:30:54.000
I got this compliment years ago when I used to walk.

457
0:30:54.000 --> 0:30:55.000
Oh my god, look at you.

458
0:30:55.000 --> 0:30:56.000
You're fair.

459
0:30:56.000 --> 0:30:57.000
You're a tall.

460
0:30:57.000 --> 0:30:58.000
You're perfect.

461
0:30:58.000 --> 0:31:00.000
Look at me now.

462
0:31:00.000 --> 0:31:02.000
You're perfect.

463
0:31:02.000 --> 0:31:09.000
Only the perfect eyes can see that.

464
0:31:09.000 --> 0:31:13.000
Only the perfect eyes will see that.

465
0:31:13.000 --> 0:31:16.000
Only the perfect eyes will see that.

466
0:31:17.000 --> 0:31:20.000
So yes.

467
0:31:20.000 --> 0:31:25.000
In all those imperfections, you have to listen to your heart.

468
0:31:25.000 --> 0:31:27.000
You don't have to look good for people.

469
0:31:27.000 --> 0:31:32.000
You don't have to be perfect just because other people want you to be perfect.

470
0:31:32.000 --> 0:31:36.000
If your soul is perfect from within, that's all right.

471
0:31:36.000 --> 0:31:39.000
This is all what you want.

472
0:31:39.000 --> 0:31:42.000
This is all what you need to be.

473
0:31:43.000 --> 0:31:53.000
Our society has made very weird, very weird kind of norms to look perfect and great.

474
0:31:53.000 --> 0:31:56.000
For men it's different, for women it's different.

475
0:31:56.000 --> 0:31:59.000
We think too much about what people say.

476
0:31:59.000 --> 0:32:02.000
We listen to ourselves too little.

477
0:32:02.000 --> 0:32:08.000
You know what makes you perfect when you make someone smile.

478
0:32:08.000 --> 0:32:11.000
You know what makes you perfect.

479
0:32:11.000 --> 0:32:15.000
You know what makes you perfect when you feel someone's pain.

480
0:32:15.000 --> 0:32:19.000
And how beautiful pain is that it connects you with people.

481
0:32:19.000 --> 0:32:22.000
No other medium can connect you with others but pain.

482
0:32:22.000 --> 0:32:27.000
That's why I always say that I'm in pain and that's a blessing in disguise for me.

483
0:32:27.000 --> 0:32:29.000
Today.

484
0:32:29.000 --> 0:32:34.000
Just because I'm in pain and I'm on the wheelchair.

485
0:32:34.000 --> 0:32:36.000
I work for children.

486
0:32:36.000 --> 0:32:39.000
Being the head of CSR for a company.

487
0:32:39.000 --> 0:32:46.000
We conduct medical camps in far-flung areas of Pakistan where so many kids die because they don't have medical facilities.

488
0:32:46.000 --> 0:32:52.000
And I personally believe just because they cannot afford to live doesn't mean we let them die.

489
0:32:52.000 --> 0:32:54.000
So we give them many.

490
0:32:54.000 --> 0:32:56.000
We give them medical treatment.

491
0:32:56.000 --> 0:32:59.000
We try to heal their wounds.

492
0:32:59.000 --> 0:33:01.000
Physical and emotional.

493
0:33:01.000 --> 0:33:05.000
And I also work for the beautiful people.

494
0:33:05.000 --> 0:33:08.000
We call them third gender.

495
0:33:08.000 --> 0:33:11.000
The transgender community of Pakistan.

496
0:33:11.000 --> 0:33:14.000
You know what connects me with them.

497
0:33:14.000 --> 0:33:17.000
All my imperfections.

498
0:33:17.000 --> 0:33:21.000
When I go and hug them, they never judge me.

499
0:33:21.000 --> 0:33:27.000
And this very good friend of mine, her name is Biceli, Biceli, Mise Electricity.

500
0:33:27.000 --> 0:33:29.000
She calls herself Electricity.

501
0:33:29.000 --> 0:33:31.000
And I said, are you Electricity?

502
0:33:31.000 --> 0:33:33.000
She says, no, I'm lightening.

503
0:33:33.000 --> 0:33:36.000
I'm as strong as lightning.

504
0:33:36.000 --> 0:33:42.000
She says we have very bad power out there.

505
0:33:42.000 --> 0:33:45.000
So she doesn't want me to call her Electricity.

506
0:33:45.000 --> 0:33:47.000
So she says, I am very strong.

507
0:33:47.000 --> 0:33:49.000
I'm Punder, I'm lightning.

508
0:33:49.000 --> 0:33:50.000
She came to me.

509
0:33:50.000 --> 0:33:55.000
And the first time I hugged her, she said, you are just like me.

510
0:33:55.000 --> 0:33:58.000
And I said, yes, I am like you.

511
0:33:58.000 --> 0:34:02.000
Because to people, we are so imperfect.

512
0:34:03.000 --> 0:34:07.000
So how beautiful these imperfections are that because of these imperfections,

513
0:34:07.000 --> 0:34:08.000
you can connect with people.

514
0:34:08.000 --> 0:34:12.000
Then why are we all running after being perfect?

515
0:34:12.000 --> 0:34:13.000
What's the point?

516
0:34:13.000 --> 0:34:22.000
Every time I go in public, I always smile.

517
0:34:22.000 --> 0:34:25.000
It's always a big two of these smile on my face.

518
0:34:25.000 --> 0:34:28.000
And people ask me, don't you get tired of smiling all the time?

519
0:34:28.000 --> 0:34:30.000
What's the secret?

520
0:34:30.000 --> 0:34:35.000
I always say one thing that I have stopped worrying about the things that I have lost,

521
0:34:35.000 --> 0:34:37.000
the people that I've lost.

522
0:34:37.000 --> 0:34:41.000
Things and people who are meant to be with me are with me.

523
0:34:41.000 --> 0:34:47.000
And sometimes, somebody's absence make you a better person.

524
0:34:47.000 --> 0:34:49.000
Charged their absence.

525
0:34:49.000 --> 0:34:55.000
It's always, it's always a blessing in disguise.

526
0:34:55.000 --> 0:34:59.000
I always say that people are so lucky that don't even realize you must be thinking,

527
0:34:59.000 --> 0:35:02.000
okay, you're lucky in what sense.

528
0:35:02.000 --> 0:35:06.000
Well, the breath that you just took was a blessing.

529
0:35:06.000 --> 0:35:08.000
Embrace it.

530
0:35:08.000 --> 0:35:21.000
There are so many people in the world who are dreaming to live a life that you are living right now.

531
0:35:21.000 --> 0:35:23.000
You have no idea.

532
0:35:24.000 --> 0:35:27.000
Embrace it and every breath that you are taking,

533
0:35:27.000 --> 0:35:30.000
celebrate your life, live it.

534
0:35:30.000 --> 0:35:33.000
Don't die before your death.

535
0:35:33.000 --> 0:35:35.000
We all die.

536
0:35:42.000 --> 0:35:48.000
We live this one routine of a day for 75 years and we call it life.

537
0:35:48.000 --> 0:35:50.000
No, that's not life.

538
0:35:51.000 --> 0:35:54.000
If you're still thinking, why you have been sent here,

539
0:35:54.000 --> 0:36:01.000
if you're still juggling with the concept of why you are here, you haven't lived yet.

540
0:36:01.000 --> 0:36:06.000
You work hard, you make money, you do it for yourself.

541
0:36:06.000 --> 0:36:08.000
That's not life.

542
0:36:08.000 --> 0:36:13.000
You go out, you seek for people who need your help, you make their lives better.

543
0:36:13.000 --> 0:36:19.000
You become that sponge which can absorb all the negativity and you become that person who can emit beautiful,

544
0:36:19.000 --> 0:36:25.000
beautiful positive vibes and when you realize that you have changed someone's life and because if you,

545
0:36:25.000 --> 0:36:28.000
this person didn't give up.

546
0:36:28.000 --> 0:36:31.000
That is the day when you live.

547
0:36:31.000 --> 0:36:33.000
Always.

548
0:36:41.000 --> 0:36:43.000
We were talking about gratitude.

549
0:36:43.000 --> 0:36:45.000
Why I smile all the time?

550
0:36:46.000 --> 0:36:51.000
I cry all night when nobody sees me because I'm a human and I have to keep the balance.

551
0:36:51.000 --> 0:36:58.000
And I smile all day because I know that if I will smile, I can make people smile.

552
0:36:58.000 --> 0:37:00.000
That keeps me going.

553
0:37:05.000 --> 0:37:08.000
Be grateful for what you have.

554
0:37:08.000 --> 0:37:12.000
And you will always, always end up having more.

555
0:37:12.000 --> 0:37:18.000
But if you'll cry and if you'll cry for the little things that you don't have or the things that you've lost,

556
0:37:18.000 --> 0:37:21.000
you will never ever have enough.

557
0:37:21.000 --> 0:37:24.000
Sometimes we are too busy thinking about the things that we don't have.

558
0:37:24.000 --> 0:37:28.000
That we forget to cherish the blessings that we have.

559
0:37:28.000 --> 0:37:36.000
I'm not saying that I'm not healthy and that makes me unlucky, but yes, it is hard.

560
0:37:36.000 --> 0:37:38.000
It is hard when I say that I cannot walk.

561
0:37:38.000 --> 0:37:42.000
It is hard to say when I wear this bag, it hurts.

562
0:37:42.000 --> 0:37:49.000
But I have to keep going because never giving up is the way to live.

563
0:37:49.000 --> 0:37:50.000
Always.

564
0:37:55.000 --> 0:38:00.000
So while end my talk on a very short note,

565
0:38:01.000 --> 0:38:08.000
live your life fully, accept yourself the way you are, be kind to yourself.

566
0:38:08.000 --> 0:38:14.000
Be kind to yourself, I'll repeat, be kind to yourself, and only then you can be kind to others.

567
0:38:14.000 --> 0:38:17.000
Love yourself and spread that love.

568
0:38:17.000 --> 0:38:18.000
Life will be hard.

569
0:38:18.000 --> 0:38:19.000
There will be turmoil.

570
0:38:19.000 --> 0:38:23.000
There will be trials, but that will only make you stronger.

571
0:38:23.000 --> 0:38:25.000
Never give up.

572
0:38:26.000 --> 0:38:32.000
The real happiness doesn't lie in money or success or fame.

573
0:38:32.000 --> 0:38:35.000
I have this all I never wanted this.

574
0:38:35.000 --> 0:38:43.000
Real happiness lies in gratitude, so be grateful, be alive, and live every moment.

575
0:38:43.000 --> 0:38:46.000
Thank you so much, everyone.

576
0:38:46.000 --> 0:38:47.000
Thank you.
