1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:11.760
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim in the name of God, the most merciful, the most beneficial.

2
0:00:11.760 --> 0:00:20.000
Your majesty's, your royal highnesses, distinguished members of the Norwajya-Nobal-Kamati,

3
0:00:20.000 --> 0:00:25.000
the sisters and brothers.

4
0:00:25.000 --> 0:00:38.000
Today's day of great happiness for me, I am humbled that the Norwajya-Kamati has selected me for this precious award.

5
0:00:38.000 --> 0:00:45.000
Thank you to everyone for your continued support and love.

6
0:00:46.000 --> 0:00:52.000
Thank you for the letters and cards that I still receive from all around the world.

7
0:00:52.000 --> 0:01:00.000
Your kind and encouraging words, strengthens and inspires me.

8
0:01:03.000 --> 0:01:09.000
I would like to thank my parents for their unconditional love.

9
0:01:09.000 --> 0:01:16.000
Thank you to my father for not clipping my wings and for letting me fly.

10
0:01:17.000 --> 0:01:43.000
Thank you to my mother for inspiring me to be patient and to always speak the truth,

11
0:01:43.000 --> 0:01:48.000
which we strongly believe is the true message of Islam.

12
0:01:48.000 --> 0:02:01.000
And also thank you to all my wonderful teachers who inspired me to believe in myself and be brave.

13
0:02:01.000 --> 0:02:11.000
I am proud, well in fact I am very proud to be the first person, the first Pakistani,

14
0:02:11.000 --> 0:02:18.000
and the youngest person to receive this award.

15
0:02:30.000 --> 0:02:39.000
Along with that, along with that, I am pretty certain that I am also the first recipient of the Norwajya-Nobal-Pee's prize

16
0:02:39.000 --> 0:02:45.000
who still fights with high younger brothers.

17
0:02:45.000 --> 0:02:57.000
I want there to be peace everywhere, but my brothers and I are still working on that.

18
0:02:57.000 --> 0:03:04.000
I am also honored to receive this award together with Kaila Satsyarthi,

19
0:03:04.000 --> 0:03:09.000
who has been a champion for children's rights for a long time.

20
0:03:09.000 --> 0:03:15.000
Twice has long, in fact, then I have been alive.

21
0:03:15.000 --> 0:03:28.000
I am proud that we can work together, we can work together and show the world that an Indian and a Pakistani,

22
0:03:29.000 --> 0:03:34.000
they can work together and achieve their goals of children's rights.

23
0:03:47.000 --> 0:03:55.000
Dear brothers and sisters, I was named after the inspirational Malala of May 1,

24
0:03:55.000 --> 0:03:59.000
who is the Pashnu in John of Arq.

25
0:03:59.000 --> 0:04:05.000
The word Malala means grief-stricken, said,

26
0:04:05.000 --> 0:04:14.000
but in order to lend some happiness to it, my grandfather would always call me Malala,

27
0:04:14.000 --> 0:04:17.000
the happiest guy in the world.

28
0:04:17.000 --> 0:04:27.000
And today I am very happy that we are together fighting for an important cause.

29
0:04:27.000 --> 0:04:33.000
This award is not just for me.

30
0:04:33.000 --> 0:04:40.000
It is for those who have forgotten children who want education.

31
0:04:40.000 --> 0:04:46.000
It is for those frightened children who want peace.

32
0:04:46.000 --> 0:04:52.000
It is for those voices children who want change.

33
0:04:52.000 --> 0:05:00.000
I am here to stand up for their rights, to raise their voice.

34
0:05:00.000 --> 0:05:04.000
It is not time to pity them.

35
0:05:04.000 --> 0:05:07.000
It is not time to pity them.

36
0:05:08.000 --> 0:05:11.000
It is time to take action.

37
0:05:11.000 --> 0:05:15.000
So it becomes the last time.

38
0:05:15.000 --> 0:05:17.000
The last time.

39
0:05:17.000 --> 0:05:24.000
So it becomes the last time that we see a child deprived of education.

40
0:05:37.000 --> 0:05:46.000
I have found that people describe me in many different ways.

41
0:05:46.000 --> 0:05:51.000
Some people call me the girl who was shot by the Taliban.

42
0:05:51.000 --> 0:05:56.000
And some the girl who fought for her rights.

43
0:05:56.000 --> 0:06:02.000
Some people call me a Nobel laureate now.

44
0:06:02.000 --> 0:06:11.000
However, my brother still called me that annoying bossy sister.

45
0:06:11.000 --> 0:06:22.000
As far as I know, I am just committed and even stubborn person who wants to see every child

46
0:06:22.000 --> 0:06:26.000
getting quality education.

47
0:06:26.000 --> 0:06:48.000
Who wants to see women having equal rights and who wants peace in every corner of the world.

48
0:06:48.000 --> 0:07:02.000
Education is one of the blessings of life and one of its necessities that has been my experience during the 17 years of my life.

49
0:07:02.000 --> 0:07:12.000
In my paradise home, I always loved learning and discovering new things.

50
0:07:12.000 --> 0:07:21.000
I remember when my friends and I would decorate our hands with herna on special occasions.

51
0:07:21.000 --> 0:07:25.000
And instead of drawing flowers and petrans,

52
0:07:25.000 --> 0:07:32.000
we would paint our hands with mathematical formulas and equations.

53
0:07:32.000 --> 0:07:36.000
We had a thirst for education.

54
0:07:36.000 --> 0:07:43.000
Because our future was right there in that classroom.

55
0:07:43.000 --> 0:07:49.000
We would sit and learn and read together.

56
0:07:49.000 --> 0:07:54.000
We loved to wear neat and tidy school uniforms.

57
0:07:54.000 --> 0:07:59.000
And we would sit there with big dreams in our eyes.

58
0:07:59.000 --> 0:08:09.000
We wanted to make our parents proud and true that we could also excel in our studies.

59
0:08:09.000 --> 0:08:16.000
And achieve those goals which some people think only boys can.

60
0:08:16.000 --> 0:08:23.000
But things did not remain the same.

61
0:08:23.000 --> 0:08:37.000
When I was in Swarth, which was a place of tourism and beauty, suddenly changed into a place of terrorism.

62
0:08:37.000 --> 0:08:43.000
I was just ten that more than 400 schools were destroyed.

63
0:08:43.000 --> 0:08:46.000
Women were flogged.

64
0:08:46.000 --> 0:08:50.000
People were killed.

65
0:08:50.000 --> 0:08:57.000
And our beautiful dreams turned into nightmares.

66
0:08:57.000 --> 0:09:03.000
Education went from being a right to being a crime.

67
0:09:03.000 --> 0:09:08.000
Girls were stopped from going to school.

68
0:09:08.000 --> 0:09:14.000
We could not just stand by and see those injustices of the terrorists.

69
0:09:14.000 --> 0:09:21.000
Denying our rights, ruthlessly killing people and misusing the name of Islam.

70
0:09:21.000 --> 0:09:27.000
We decided to raise our voice and tell them,

71
0:09:27.000 --> 0:09:35.000
Have you not learned that in the Holy Quran Allah says,

72
0:09:35.000 --> 0:09:40.000
If you kill one person, it is as if you kill the whole humanity.

73
0:09:40.000 --> 0:09:49.000
Do you not know that Muhammad, these were upon him, the Prophet of Mercy, he says,

74
0:09:49.000 --> 0:09:52.000
Do not harm yourself or others.

75
0:09:52.000 --> 0:10:03.000
And do you not know that the very first word of the Holy Quran is the word Iqra, which means read.

76
0:10:04.000 --> 0:10:18.000
The terrorists tried to stop us and it takes me and my friends who are here today on our school bus in 2012.

77
0:10:18.000 --> 0:10:23.000
But neither their ideas nor their bullets could win.

78
0:10:23.000 --> 0:10:25.000
We survived.

79
0:10:25.000 --> 0:10:31.000
And since that day our voices have grown louder and louder.

80
0:10:31.000 --> 0:10:53.000
Thank you.

81
0:10:54.000 --> 0:11:03.000
I tell my story not because it is unique but because it is not.

82
0:11:03.000 --> 0:11:06.000
It is the story of many girls.

83
0:11:06.000 --> 0:11:11.000
Today I tell their stories too.

84
0:11:11.000 --> 0:11:19.000
I have brought with me some of my sisters from Pakistan, from Nigeria and from Syria,

85
0:11:19.000 --> 0:11:22.000
who share this story.

86
0:11:22.000 --> 0:11:29.000
My brave sisters, Shahzian Kainat, who are also short that day on our school bus.

87
0:11:29.000 --> 0:11:33.000
But day, her not stop learning.

88
0:11:33.000 --> 0:11:45.000
In my brave sister, Kainat Sombro, who went through severe abuse and extreme violence.

89
0:11:46.000 --> 0:11:52.000
Even her brother was killed but she did not succumb.

90
0:11:52.000 --> 0:11:59.000
Also my sisters here, whom I have met during my Malala front campaign.

91
0:11:59.000 --> 0:12:09.000
My 16 year old courageous sister, Mozoon, from Syria, who now lives in Jordan as a refugee.

92
0:12:09.000 --> 0:12:16.000
And she goes from tent to tent, encouraging girls and boys to learn.

93
0:12:16.000 --> 0:12:29.000
In my sister, Amina, from the north of Nigeria, where Boco Haram threatens and stops girls and even kidnaps girls.

94
0:12:29.000 --> 0:12:33.000
Just for wanting to go to school.

95
0:12:34.000 --> 0:12:38.000
The I appear as one gun.

96
0:12:38.000 --> 0:12:41.000
The I appear as one gun.

97
0:12:41.000 --> 0:12:51.000
One person, who is five foot, two inches tall, if you include my high heels.

98
0:12:51.000 --> 0:12:57.000
It means I am five foot only.

99
0:12:57.000 --> 0:13:00.000
I am not a lone voice.

100
0:13:00.000 --> 0:13:02.000
I am not a lone voice.

101
0:13:02.000 --> 0:13:04.000
I am many.

102
0:13:04.000 --> 0:13:06.000
I am Malala.

103
0:13:06.000 --> 0:13:08.000
But I am also Shahzian.

104
0:13:08.000 --> 0:13:09.000
I am Kainat.

105
0:13:09.000 --> 0:13:11.000
I am Kainat Sombro.

106
0:13:11.000 --> 0:13:13.000
I am Mozoon.

107
0:13:13.000 --> 0:13:15.000
I am Amina.

108
0:13:15.000 --> 0:13:22.000
I am those 66 million girls for the pride of education.

109
0:13:23.000 --> 0:13:27.000
And today, I am not raising my voice.

110
0:13:27.000 --> 0:13:31.000
It is the voice of those 66 million girls.

111
0:13:53.000 --> 0:14:13.000
Sometimes people like to ask me, why should girls go to school?

112
0:14:13.000 --> 0:14:17.000
Why is it important for them?

113
0:14:17.000 --> 0:14:24.000
But I think the more important question is, why shouldn't they?

114
0:14:24.000 --> 0:14:29.000
Why shouldn't they have this right to go to school?

115
0:14:29.000 --> 0:14:32.000
Get with us in sisters.

116
0:14:32.000 --> 0:14:39.000
Today, in half of the world, we see rapid progress and development.

117
0:14:39.000 --> 0:14:54.000
However, there are many countries where millions still suffer from the very old problems of war, poverty and injustice.

118
0:14:54.000 --> 0:15:06.000
We still see conflicts in which innocent people lose their lives and children become orphans.

119
0:15:06.000 --> 0:15:15.000
We see many people becoming refugees in Syria, Gaza and Iraq.

120
0:15:15.000 --> 0:15:26.000
In Afghanistan, we see families being killed in suicide or take some bomb blasts.

121
0:15:26.000 --> 0:15:34.000
Many children in Africa do not have access to education because of poverty.

122
0:15:34.000 --> 0:15:46.000
And as I said, we still see, we still see girls who have no freedom to go to school in the north of Nigeria.

123
0:15:46.000 --> 0:16:03.000
Many children in countries like Pakistan and India, as Kaila Sathyarthi mentioned, many children, especially in India and Pakistan, are deprived of their right to education.

124
0:16:03.000 --> 0:16:14.000
Because of social tables or they have been forced into child marriage or into child labour.

125
0:16:14.000 --> 0:16:31.000
One of my very good school friends, the same age as me, who has always been bold and confident girl, dreamt of becoming a doctor.

126
0:16:32.000 --> 0:16:36.000
But her dream reminded dream.

127
0:16:36.000 --> 0:16:41.000
At the age of 12, she was forced to get married.

128
0:16:41.000 --> 0:16:47.000
And then soon she had a son, she had a child.

129
0:16:47.000 --> 0:16:52.000
When she herself was a child, only 14.

130
0:16:52.000 --> 0:16:59.000
I know that she could have been a very good doctor, but she couldn't.

131
0:16:59.000 --> 0:17:03.000
Because she was a girl.

132
0:17:03.000 --> 0:17:17.000
Her story is why I dedicate the Nobel Peace Prize money to the Malala Fund to help give girls quality education, everywhere anywhere in the world.

133
0:17:17.000 --> 0:17:26.000
And to raise their voices, the first place is funding will go to is where my heart is.

134
0:17:26.000 --> 0:17:33.000
To build schools in Pakistan, especially in my home of Swat and Shangla.

135
0:17:47.000 --> 0:17:57.000
In my own village, there is still no secondary school for girls.

136
0:17:57.000 --> 0:18:14.000
And it is my wish and my commitment and now my challenge to build one, so that my friends and my sisters can go there to school and get quality education.

137
0:18:14.000 --> 0:18:20.000
And they get this opportunity to fulfill their dreams.

138
0:18:20.000 --> 0:18:28.000
This is where I will begin, but it is not where I will stop.

139
0:18:28.000 --> 0:18:37.000
I will continue this fight until I see every child in school.

140
0:18:37.000 --> 0:18:50.000
There were the ancestors, great people who brought change, like Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela.

141
0:18:50.000 --> 0:18:57.000
Mother Teresa and Lang Sang Sui, once stood here on this stage.

142
0:18:57.000 --> 0:19:10.000
I hope the steps that Kaila satyati and I have taken so far and will take on this journey will also bring change, lasting change.

143
0:19:27.000 --> 0:19:32.000
My great hope is that this will be the last time.

144
0:19:32.000 --> 0:19:36.000
This will be the last time we must fight for education.

145
0:19:36.000 --> 0:19:41.000
Let's solve this once and for all.

146
0:19:41.000 --> 0:19:45.000
We have already taken many steps.

147
0:19:45.000 --> 0:19:51.000
Now it is time to take a leap.

148
0:19:51.000 --> 0:19:57.000
It is not time to tell the world leaders to realise how important education is.

149
0:19:57.000 --> 0:20:00.000
They already know it.

150
0:20:00.000 --> 0:20:04.000
Their own children are in good schools.

151
0:20:04.000 --> 0:20:14.000
Now it is time to call them to take action for the rest of the world's children.

152
0:20:15.000 --> 0:20:23.000
We ask the world leaders to unite and make education their top priority.

153
0:20:23.000 --> 0:20:33.000
15 years ago, the world leaders decided on a set of global goals, the Millennium Development goals.

154
0:20:33.000 --> 0:20:39.000
In the years that have followed, we have seen some progress.

155
0:20:39.000 --> 0:20:44.000
The number of children out of school has been halved as Kaila satyati said.

156
0:20:44.000 --> 0:20:54.000
However, the world focused on your own primary education and progress did not reach everyone.

157
0:20:54.000 --> 0:21:05.000
In year 2015, representatives from all around the world will meet in the United Nations

158
0:21:05.000 --> 0:21:13.000
to set the next set of goals, sustainable development goals.

159
0:21:13.000 --> 0:21:20.000
This will set the world's ambition for the next generations.

160
0:21:20.000 --> 0:21:32.000
The world can no longer accept that the world can no longer accept that basic education is enough.

161
0:21:33.000 --> 0:21:43.000
Why do leaders accept that for children in developing countries, only basic literacy is sufficient

162
0:21:43.000 --> 0:21:51.000
when their own children do homework in algebra, mathematics, science and physics?

163
0:21:52.000 --> 0:22:06.000
Leaders must seize this opportunity to guarantee a free quality, primary and secondary education for every child.

164
0:22:07.000 --> 0:22:34.000
Some will say this is impractical or too expensive or too hard or maybe even impossible, but it is time the world thinks bigger.

165
0:22:34.000 --> 0:22:49.000
The sisters and brothers, the so-called world of adults, may understand it, but we children don't.

166
0:22:49.000 --> 0:23:03.000
Why is it that countries which we call strong are so powerful in creating wars, but are so weak in bringing peace?

167
0:23:03.000 --> 0:23:28.000
Why is it that giving guns is so easy, but giving books is so hard?

168
0:23:28.000 --> 0:23:43.000
Why is it that making tanks is so easy, but building schools is so hard?

169
0:23:43.000 --> 0:23:52.000
We are living in the modern age and we believe that nothing is impossible.

170
0:23:52.000 --> 0:24:11.000
We have reached the moon, 45 years ago, and maybe we will soon land on Mars, then in this 21st century we must be able to give every child quality education.

171
0:24:11.000 --> 0:24:21.000
The sisters and brothers, the earth and children, we must work, not wait.

172
0:24:21.000 --> 0:24:29.000
Not just the politicians and the world leaders, we all need to contribute.

173
0:24:29.000 --> 0:24:36.000
Me, you, we, it is our duty.

174
0:24:36.000 --> 0:24:44.000
Let us become the first generation to decide to be the last.

175
0:24:44.000 --> 0:24:58.000
Let us become the first generation that decides to be the last, that sees empty classrooms, lost child holds and wasted potentials.

176
0:24:58.000 --> 0:25:10.000
Let this be the last time that a girl or a boy spends their childhood in a factory.

177
0:25:10.000 --> 0:25:19.000
Let this be the last time that a girl is forced into early child marriage.

178
0:25:19.000 --> 0:25:26.000
Let this be the last time that a child loses life in war.

179
0:25:26.000 --> 0:25:33.000
Let this be the last time that we see a child out of school.

180
0:25:33.000 --> 0:25:35.000
Let this end with us.

181
0:25:35.000 --> 0:25:39.000
Let's begin this ending together.

182
0:25:39.000 --> 0:25:45.000
Today, right here, right now, let's begin this ending now.

183
0:25:45.000 --> 0:25:47.000
Thank you so much.

184
0:25:47.000 --> 0:25:50.000
Thank you.

185
0:25:56.000 --> 0:26:06.000
Thank you.
