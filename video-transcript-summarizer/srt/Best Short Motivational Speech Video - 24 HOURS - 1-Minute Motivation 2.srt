1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:03.400
If you only have 24 hours in a day,

2
0:00:03.400 --> 0:00:05.800
your success is the pin of the paw,

3
0:00:05.800 --> 0:00:08.400
how you use the 24.

4
0:00:08.400 --> 0:00:10.600
You got to hear me. People talk about open-whip free,

5
0:00:10.600 --> 0:00:12.700
you know, K-turner, warm, buff it.

6
0:00:12.700 --> 0:00:15.000
Listen to me. I don't get how much money you make.

7
0:00:15.000 --> 0:00:16.900
You only get 24 hours in a day.

8
0:00:16.900 --> 0:00:20.200
And the difference between Oprah and the person that's broke

9
0:00:20.200 --> 0:00:25.000
is Oprah uses her 24 hours wisely.

10
0:00:25.000 --> 0:00:26.200
That's it. Listen to me.

11
0:00:26.200 --> 0:00:28.000
That's it. You get 24.

12
0:00:28.000 --> 0:00:30.400
I don't care. You broke. You grew up broke.

13
0:00:30.400 --> 0:00:32.000
I don't care. You grew up rich.

14
0:00:32.000 --> 0:00:33.600
I don't care if you're in college.

15
0:00:33.600 --> 0:00:34.600
You're not in college.

16
0:00:34.600 --> 0:00:36.400
You only get 24 hours.

17
0:00:36.400 --> 0:00:39.000
And I blew up literally.

18
0:00:39.000 --> 0:00:41.600
I went from being a high school drop-out.

19
0:00:41.600 --> 0:00:44.000
To sell in 6,000 books in less than 6 months.

20
0:00:44.000 --> 0:00:46.800
We're after 24 hours.

21
0:00:46.800 --> 0:00:49.000
I was like, okay, Eric, you got to get a grip on you 24 hours

22
0:00:49.000 --> 0:00:51.200
because you bought to be broke for the rest of your life.

23
0:00:51.200 --> 0:00:52.800
And just all I need you to do for me.

24
0:00:52.800 --> 0:00:54.600
I can tell you all about your life.

25
0:00:54.600 --> 0:00:57.100
If you just write down your 24 hour schedule for me,

26
0:00:57.100 --> 0:00:57.900
you let me look at it.

27
0:00:57.900 --> 0:00:59.300
I can tell you where you're going to be.

28
0:00:59.300 --> 0:01:00.500
I can tell you where you're going to be.

29
0:01:00.500 --> 0:01:01.700
I can tell you where you're going to be.

30
0:01:01.700 --> 0:01:03.700
20 years of you keep that schedule.
